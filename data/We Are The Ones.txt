<VERSE>
For everyone of us, 
there is a destiny
Painted by people like you and me
Within these very hands, 
there is a special key
To who we are and all we can be
And we know, 
there are choices to make
Finding right roads to take
We'll conquer the skies
We know we'll try

<CHORUS>
We are a people of passion
We are the ones with the dreams
We are the ones who will fashion
Visions for tomorrow
Courage for today
Foundations that are here to stay
We are the ones who find a way

<VERSE>
With friends and families, 
we'll learn to care
Letting them know that we'll always be there
To keep the ties we have, 
both firm and strong
So that our hearts will know where we belong
Now we learn to change with the times
With one heart and mind
Keeping open the doors
Reaching out cause there's so much more
