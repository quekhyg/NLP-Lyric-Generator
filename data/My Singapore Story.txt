<VERSE>
Born in your sunshine
Cooled by your rain
The green of your morning
When the day dawns again

<VERSE>
You are my story
My Singapore story
My heart and my homeland
Forever you'll be

<VERSE>
I've crossed the wide oceans
And your light still shines through
It's then I remember
What my heart always knew

You are my story
My Singapore story
My heart and my homeland
The whole world can see

<CHORUS>
My Singapore story
I'll write it with pride
Though words cannot tell you
What I'm feeling inside
My Singapore story
I'll tell it with pride
Singapore story
It's yours and mine

<BRIDGE>
Your light fills my pages
Wherever I go
I've a story to tell
The whole world will know

<CHORUS>
My Singapore story
I'll write it with pride
Though words cannot tell you
What I'm feeling inside
My Singapore story
I'll tell it with pride
Singapore story
It's yours and mine
Singapore story
It's yours and mine
Singapore story
It's yours and mine
