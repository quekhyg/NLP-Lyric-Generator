<VERSE>
Moon is shining bright alone I sit beside
River of dreams I ask of you
Tell me, will he be as fine as I have dreamed
Do you think he's waiting for me too

<VERSE>
In the candle light I see them passing by
Two by two along the river side
But I won't be blue as long as I have you
River won't you make my dream come true

<CHORUS>
And finally when we meet
Will he recognise me
Have we already met before
On a quiet evening
Another night like this
Maybe he's been here before

<VERSE>
Moon is shining bright alone I sit beside
River of dreams I ask of you
Tell me, will he be as fine as I have dreamed
Do you think he's waiting for me too
River won't you make my dream come true
