<VERSE>
Didn't they used to say we're ordinary
Didn't we take it as that and put ourselves down
Don't we all don't we all think it's necessary
To prove to them that we'll be
We'll be someone someday
Aren't you tired so very tired of waiting
For something else someone else to give us a hand
Pick yourself up pick yourself up get ready
We'll go make a difference
We'll be someone someday

<CHORUS>
That's right we'll make you proud of us
You and me
That means that we should be happy
Let it come to us naturally

<VERSE>
Look around look around us
Weren't there many 
who patronised contradict us and pushed us aside
Recognise realise start believing
Sure there'll be some despair
But don't let yourself fall
