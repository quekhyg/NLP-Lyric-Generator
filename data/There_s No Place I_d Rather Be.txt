<VERSE>
I've walked the streets of Cairo and Bombay
I've seen the neon signs on old Broadway
I've climbed the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall in one hour
Experienced Sweet and Sour but that's okay

<VERSE>
Seen Hollywood, the sunsets in LA
The London Bridge, Big Ben, the Thames, UK
I've crossed the River Kwai yet still I don't know why
I think of you each night and every day

<CHORUS>
There's no place I'd rather be
You'll always be a part of me
And even though I've roamed the world
It's still my home I long to see
This is where my family
And my friends grew up with me
So I'll cross the skies and sail the seas
To be where I wanna be

<VERSE>
I've braved the rain in Spain, danced in Taipei
I've queued in the West End to catch the plays
Discovered I loved snow, oh nights in San Francisco
But it's still you I miss when i'm away

<CHORUS>
There's no place I'd rather be
You'll always be a part of me
And even though I've roamed the world
It's still my home I long to see
This is where my family
And my friends grew up with me
So I'll cross the skies and sail the seas
To be where I wanna be

<CHORUS>
There's no place I'd rather be
You'll always be a part of me
And even though I've roamed the world
It's still my home I long to see
This is where my family
And my friends grow old with me
So I'll cross the skies and sail the seas
To be where I wanna be
Cos there's no place I'd rather be
