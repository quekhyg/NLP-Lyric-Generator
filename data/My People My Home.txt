<VERSE>
Who are you, my country?
More than celebrations and tears
More than memories put together
Or the summing up of years

<VERSE>
I see you enduring all weathers
Sunshine and storms at your heart
In your face the lines ever changing
Tell the story where I have a part

<CHORUS>
You, My people, My home
Our lives defend and uphold
May the good we achieve as one nation
Be shared with the world

<VERSE>
As a new chapter begins
From where we have come thus far
Once again may it be written
You are who we are

<VERSE>
In you may we see ourselves
Your needs your strength in us
That the work for freedom and peace
Is mine as much as ours

<CHORUS>
You, My people, My home
Our lives defend and uphold
May the good we achieve as one nation
Be shared with the world

<CHORUS>
You, My people, My home
Our lives defend and uphold
May the good we achieve as one nation
Be shared with the world
May the good we achieve as one nation
Be shared with the world
