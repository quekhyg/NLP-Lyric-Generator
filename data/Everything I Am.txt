<VERSE>
I want you to understand
Because of you, I am who I am
Because of who you are
I can be everything I am

<VERSE>
Show me how I should be strong
Teach me that I can be weak
Because of who you are
I can find anything I seek

<PRECHORUS>
And in each other, there will be
The colours of your tapestry
Colours you've never seen

<CHORUS>
Here's to my home, to my homeland
To every shining crystal in the sand
Because of who you are I can be everything I am

<CHORUS>
Here's to you, to my homeland
I hold this precious jewel in my hand
Because of who you are I can be everything I am

<VERSE>
Teacher, teach me to be kind
Quick to embrace And slow to close my mind
If we reach the star We'll have the universe in time

<PRECHORUS>
And in each other, there will be
The fabric of our destiny
It's more than you and me

<CHORUS>
Here's to my home, to my homeland
A sea of shining crystals in the sand
Because of who you are I can be everything I am

<CHORUS>
Here's to you, Singapore
Here's to my people, I could want nothing more
Here's to you, Singapore
We hold this precious jewel in our hands
Because of who you are
Because of who you are I can be everything I am
