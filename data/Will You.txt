Will you make this island
Amazing in all ways
Surprises every corner
Delightful nights and days
Will you take this country
And turn it from a place
To a home that greets you
With smiles on every face
Will you come on this brave journey
Will you help to make it real
Will you write us grand new stories
Songs that everyone will feel

<CHORUS>
So will you swim the current
Will you scale new heights
Will you make it happen
Will you let your dreams take flight
And will you make the difference
Will you seize the day
Will you live each moment
Will you dare to find new ways
