<VERSE>
We have a vision for tomorrow
just believe, just believe
We have a goal for Singapore
we can achieve, we can achieve

<PRECHORUS>
You and me, we'll do our part
stand together, heart to heart
We're going to show the world what Singapore can be
We can achieve, we can achieve

<VERSE>
There is something down the road that we can strive for
We are told no dream's too bold that we can't try for 

<PRECHORUS>
There's a spirit in the air
it's a feeling we all share
We're going to build a better life, for you and me
We can achieve, we can achieve

<CHORUS>
Count on me Singapore
count on me to give my best and more

<PRECHORUS>
You and me, we'll do our part
stand together, heart to heart
We're going to show the world what Singapore can be
We can achieve, we can achieve

<CHORUS>
Count on me Singapore
Count on me Singapore
Count on me to give my best and more
Together, Singapore, Singapore
We can achieve, together, Singapore
We can achieve, together, Singapore
We can achieve, Singapore, my best and more
Together, Singapore, Singapore
Together, Singapore, Singapore
Together, Singapore, Singapore
