<VERSE>
Stand up for Singapore, 
do the best you can
Reach out for your fellow man
You've got to make a stand
Recognise you can play your part
Let it come right from your heart
Be prepared to give a little more

<CHORUS>
Stand up, stand up for Singapore

<VERSE>
Stand up for Singapore, 
do it with a smile
If you stand up for Singapore
You'll find it all worthwhile
Believe in yourself, you've got something to share
So show us all you really care
Be prepared to give a little more

<CHORUS>
Stand up, stand up for Singapore

<BRIDGE>
Singapore our home and nation
Together with determination
Join in like we've never done before

<CHORUS>
Stand up, stand up for Singapore

<CHORUS>
Stand up, stand up for Singapore

<CHORUS>
Stand up, stand up for Singapore
