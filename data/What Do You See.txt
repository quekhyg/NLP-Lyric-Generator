<VERSE>
There's a jewel on the ocean,
a gem upon the sea
Where the future is an open book
A land of destiny
We could set our sights into the wind and sail the seven seas
or climb the highest mountain top as long as we believe
What do you see 
What do you see

<CHORUS>
See the moon and the stars, 
look how far we have come
Look around at our faces, 
they shine brightly in the sun
With our hopes and dreams, 
imagine what tomorrow it may bring
What do you see
What do you see

<VERSE>
Now the time has come to reach out,
To open up to see
That we stand together in this land
Cos we are family
As thoughts of reaching to the sky are carried on a dream
With hearts and minds united, our dreams we will achieve
What do you see
What do you see

<CHORUS>
See the moon and the stars, 
look how far we have come
Look around at our faces, 
they shine brightly in the sun
With our hopes and dreams, 
imagine what tomorrow it may bring
What do you see

<BRIDGE>
What do you see when life makes you take on a mountain
Youll see that nothings gonna stand in your way
Together we can share
The strength of a million
and the courage of a million more

<CHORUS>
See the moon and the stars, 
look how far we have come
Look around at our faces, 
they shine brightly in the sun
With our hopes and dreams, 
imagine what tomorrow it may bring
Cos the skys the only limit when youre not afraid to dream
What do you see
What do you see
