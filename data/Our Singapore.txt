<VERSE>
It isn't easy building something out of nothing
Especially when the road ahead's a rocky one
But if we gather all our courage and conviction
And hold our dream up high, the challenge will be won

<CHORUS>
So now we look around us and we see
A nation built with love by you and me
A land to treasure right to the core
Our home, our heart, our Singapore

<CHORUS>
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Our home, our heart, our Singapore

<VERSE>
Through many years gone by, we moved ahead together
We built a brave new world where we could shine and grow
And now we only have to look towards tomorrow
To carry on the dream as far as it will go

<CHORUS>
So now we look around us and we see
A nation built with love by you and me
A land to treasure right to the core
Our home, our heart, our Singapore

<CHORUS>
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Our home, our heart, our Singapore

<BRIDGE>
And amazing as it seems
It all started with a dream
And our dreaming isn't done
Cos the best is yet to come

<CHORUS>
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Our home, our heart, our Singapore

<CHORUS>
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Our home, our heart, our dreams
Our Singapore
Ooh Singapore
Ooh Singapore
Our Singapore
