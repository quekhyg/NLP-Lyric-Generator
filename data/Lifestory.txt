<VERSE>
Wake up, she said
Look it's a beautiful day
Downstairs to the kitchen door
And then away
Into the light
Morning feeling lives on
Come the clouds, the moon
And morning is gone

<VERSE>
Born today some years ago
And had a happy childhood
But I fell in love and out
Nothing changed
Lived a life of nothing much
But then how much can one expect?
So there you are
My life has gone
But I'm the same

<CHORUS>
Just my life story
Minute by second a story
That goes on forever with each breath that I take
This is my life story
Uneventfullest story
That ages with each year and birthday cake

<VERSE>
Get up, he said
Hurry or you might be late
Everyday you hurry off to keep your days
Learn something new
What are you hoping to prove?
Make some money
Find a wife
Have a kid or two

<VERSE>
Thinking back
I like to dream of things I would have done
If I were braver then again I'm not
What's there to do?
Maybe if I had another chance
I'd go into my past
And make my life a better one
For me and you

<CHORUS>
Just my life story
Minute by second a story
That goes on forever with each breath that I take
This is my life story
Uneventfullest story
That ages with each year and birthday cake

<VERSE>
When its time
And I must close
I'll write a book
And sign it X
And send it to some true romance type magazine somewhere
Then the world will read of me
And say there lived a hero
But too late my friends and enemies
I guess life isn't fair

<OTHERS>
So my life story
Is self-explanatory
Won't you please start from page one
And do go on
Till I am done
