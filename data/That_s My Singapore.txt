<VERSE>
Rise up in the morning
Hear birds singing in the trees
That's my Singapore
Look out of the window
Watching people exercise
That's my Singapore
Sit at the breakfast table
Reading headlines on the news
That's my Singapore
Thinking of my future
Looking forward to each day
That's my Singapore

<PRECHORUS>
We just don't realise how fortunate we are
Sometimes we wonder how we ever came this far
Don't take for granted that these good things never end
Let's work together everybody lend a hand

<CHORUS>
It's a homely feeling
Everyone here is so nice
We share a common dream
Homely feeling
Living here's like paradise
The place is clean and green

<VERSE>
Travelling to the workplace
Meeting colleagues and my peers
That's my Singapore
Working nine to five
Sometimes working even more
That's my Singapore
Feeling tired and stressed out
I'm on the verge of passing out
That's my Singapore
Leaving work for home
It's the best place to unwind
That's my Singapore

<PRECHORUS>
We just don't realise how fortunate we are
Sometimes we wonder how we ever came this far
Don't take for granted that these good things never end
Let's work together everybody lend a hand

<CHORUS>
It's a homely feeling
Everyone here is so nice
We share a common dream
Homely feeling
Living here's like paradise
The place is clean and green
