<VERSE>
Many years have passed since independence
We are the future generation of that day
Times went by with many changes
As we prospered through the ages
We're so very international today

<VERSE>
A price was paid to reach world recognition
By dedicated men who paved the way
What a great divine blessing
That our nation's still progressing
We're singing songs of our beautiful island
with joyful melody

<CHORUS>
Sing sing sing
Songs of our country
Sing sing sing
As we live in harmony
Sing sing sing
With our friends and family
Singing Singaporean style in unity

<VERSE>
You can hardly spot our island on the world map
Yet the tourists they keep coming every day
People come from every nation
Say our food's such a sensation
Our hawker centre's cooking night and day

<VERSE>
As we gaze upon the far horizon
We may wonder what our future has in store
It's a struggle we all know it
But we're lions don't forget it
We will face the storms and reach the stars
That shine upon our shore

<CHORUS>
Sing sing sing
Songs of our country
Sing sing sing
As we live in harmony
Sing sing sing
With our friends and family
Singing Singaporean style in unity
