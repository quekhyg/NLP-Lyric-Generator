<VERSE>
In the early years Our poor pioneers
Worked down by the riverside
Drawn from many lands With dreams in their hands
The values they gave us survive

<VERSE>
As four streams flow To make one river grow
So we came together as one
We live side by side And share island wide
A style Singaporean

<CHORUS>
This is our home A home that's grown
From a little room To a country of our own
Now we welcome everyone to see
Singapore - a city for the world

<VERSE>
We reach out our hands To friends in far off lands
And bridge dividing streams
Together we can build A world which is filled
With hope of the Singapore dream

<CHORUS>
This is our home A home that's grown
From a little room To a country of our own
Now we welcome everyone to see
Singapore - a city for the world

<CHORUS>
This is our home A home that's grown
From a little room To a country of our own
Now we welcome everyone to see
Singapore - a city for the world

<CHORUS>
This is our home A home that's grown
From a little room To a country of our own
Now we welcome everyone to see
Singapore - a city for the world
A nation's home that's safe and free
A city for the world
