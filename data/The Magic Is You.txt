<VERSE>
Ever since we came to be
You were always there for me
I hear you breathe, I see you smile
You have made our lives worthwhile
It's your warmth, your beautiful touch
It makes me remember so much
Of the pleasure I treasure
So love on we must

<CHORUS>
No matter when
No matter where you may go
You know my heart will always stay
For you are here
I know you always will be
It's all because the magic is you

<VERSE>
We've had dreams, they seemed unreal
We've had hope, they gave us zeal
But dreams came true and hopes unfurled
My island's grown into a world
There've been days of laughter and pain
But family and friends will remain
We have grown here together
Let's keep it that way
