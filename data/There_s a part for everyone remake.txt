<VERSE>
There's a part for everyone, 
in this land where we belong
There's a part for one and all, 
to keep our nation strong
Many things that we can do, 
to help defend our land
Let us all do what we can, 
together hand in hand

<CHORUS>
Put your heart, your mind, your will to our defence 
Put your heart, your mind, your will to our defence
If we all unite as one, we can defend our Singapore
With our heart, our mind, our will forever more

<VERSE>
What we have is worth defending
With a love that's never failing
Always ready, strong and steady
Let's heed the call, come one and all
There's a part for everyone, 
in this land where we belong
We can do it, you and I, 
we'll keep our nation strong

<CHORUS>
Put your heart, your mind, your will to our defence
Put your heart, your mind, your will to our defence
If we all unite as one, we can defend our Singapore
With our heart, our mind, our will forever more

<CHORUS>
Put your heart, your mind, your will to our defence
Put your heart, your mind, your will to our defence
If we all unite as one, we can defend our Singapore
With our heart, our mind, our will forever more

<CHORUS>
Put your heart, your mind, your will to our defence
Put your heart, your mind, your will to our defence
If we all unite as one, we can defend our Singapore
With our heart, our mind, our will forever more
With our heart, our mind, our will forever more
