<VERSE>
First light, Rolls across my peaceful isle
Mornings, I wake up, refreshed, renewed
Ready to meet the bright new day
So much to look forward to

<VERSE>
Daylight, The city has stirred to life
Your smiles, Put a spring in my step
There's a feeling that binds us one and all
Different stories, shared memories

<CHORUS>
I love my city's lively ways
Warm sunny days
Sights and sounds, Special tastes
That add up to this place
I love my friends, my closest ties
Now I finally realize
When it feels this right
You know that it's love at first light

<VERSE>
Night fall,Stars twinkling on the bay
My dreams can take flight if I dare
There's a feeling that binds us one and all
We look forward to a brighter day

<CHORUS>
I love my city's lively ways
Warm sunny days
Sights and sounds, Special tastes
That add up to this place
I love my friends, my closest ties
Now I finally realize
When it feels this right
You know that it's 
love at first light

<BRIDGE>
Hand in hand, we'll find new strength
And see our dreams take flight in Singapore
Singapore

<CHORUS>
I love my city's lively ways 
Warm sunny days 
Sights and sounds, special tastes 
That add up to this place 
I love my friends, my closest ties
Now I finally realize
When it feels this right
You know that it's 
love at first light
When it feels this right
You know that it's
Love at first light
