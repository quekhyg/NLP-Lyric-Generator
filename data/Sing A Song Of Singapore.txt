<VERSE>
I want the world to know about my island in the sun
Where happy children play and shout and smile for everyone
In city streets, in parks so green, in high rise housings new
In every place so fresh and clean, on sunny beaches too

<CHORUS>
Sing a song of Singapore Sing with joy and ease
Sing aloud to every shore Sing of hope and peace
Sing a song of Singapore Sing with joy and ease
Sing aloud to every shore Sing of hope and peace

<VERSE>
I want the world to see my home, the country of my birth
Where brave and loyal men have sown the seeds of strength and mirth
Where different races proudly share their heritage and lore
That our sons and daughters will always care to sing of Singapore

<CHORUS>
Sing a song of Singapore Sing with joy and ease
Sing aloud to every shore Sing of hope and peace
Sing a song of Singapore Sing with joy and ease
Sing aloud to every shore Sing of hope and peace
