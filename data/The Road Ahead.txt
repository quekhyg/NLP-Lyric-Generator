<VERSE>
One man on an island
One drop in the sea
All it takes to set a wave in motion
Is a single word, an action
A hope that we can be
The change that we've been longing to see

<PRECHORUS>
For our home, our land, our family
It's all within our reach

<CHORUS>
See this island, 
every grain of sand
Hear this anthem, 
it's the voices of our friends
Come whatever 
on the road ahead
We did it before, 
and we'll do it again

<VERSE>
When the moments turn to hours
And the day's last light is gone
Look around us always and remember
There were times we were uncertain
But we just kept walking on
It's always darkest just before the dawn

<CHORUS>
See this island, 
every grain of sand
Hear this anthem, 
it's the voices of our friends
Come whatever 
on the road ahead
We did it before, 
and we'll do it again

<BRIDGE>
Our home, the home we share
Where the garden always grows toward the light
Though the road ahead is daunting,
I know we're gonna be alright

<CHORUS>
See this island, 
every grain of sand
Hear this anthem, 
it's the voices of our friends
Come whatever 
on the road ahead
We did it before, 
and we'll do it again
