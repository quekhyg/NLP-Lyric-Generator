<VERSE>
There was a time when people said
that Singapore won't make it 
but we did
There was a time when troubles seemed 
too much for us to take
but we did
We built a nation, 
strong and free
Reaching out together
For peace and harmony

<CHORUS>
This is my country, 
this is my flag
This is my future, 
this is my life
This is my family, 
these are my friends
We are Singapore, 
Singaporeans
Singapore our homeland, 
it's here that we belong
All of us united, 
one people marching on
We've come so far together, 
our common destiny
Singapore forever, 
a nation strong and free
This is my country, 
this is my flag
This is my future, 
this is my life
This is my family, 
these are my friends
We are Singapore, 
Singaporeans

<VERSE>
We the citizens of Singapore
Pledge ourselves as one united people
Regardless of race language or religion
To build a democratic society
Based on justice and equality
So as to achieve happiness
Prosperity and progress for our nation

<CHORUS>
We are Singapore, 
we are Singapore
We will stand together, 
hear the lion roar
We are Singapore, 
we are Singapore
We're a nation strong and free 
forevermore
This is my country, 
this is my flag
This is my future, 
this is my life
This is my family, 
these are my friends
We are Singapore, 
Singaporeans
We are Singapore, 
we are Singapore
We will stand together, 
hear the lion roar
We are Singapore, 
we are Singapore
We're a nation strong and free 
forevermore
We are Singapore, 
Singaporeans 
We are Singapore, 
Singaporeans
