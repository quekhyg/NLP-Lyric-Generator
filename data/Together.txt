<VERSE>
Let us be together
aspire to achieve
No matter what, 
no matter when,
Working hand in hand
Let us go the distance, 
reach for goals that shine
Creating our future, 
with everyone in mind

<CHORUS>
Together we make a difference, 
one voice, one destiny
We remain undivided, our hearts in harmony
Together we make a difference, 
our friends, our families
We will share a special dream
Together we feel the Singapore heartbeat

<VERSE>
Let us find in our strides, 
new strength to go on by
Nothing is ever easy, 
we have to hold on and strive
Let us never be afraid, 
if we have to change our ways
Through the years, we'll always stay, 
one in every way

<CHORUS>
Together we make a difference, 
one voice, one destiny
We remain undivided, our hearts in harmony
Together we make a difference, 
our friends, our families
We will share a special dream
Together we feel the Singapore heartbeat

<CHORUS>
Together we make a difference, 
one voice, one destiny
We remain undivided, our hearts in harmony
Together we make a difference, 
our friends, our families
We will share a special dream
Together we feel the Singapore heartbeat
We will share a special dream
Together we feel the Singapore heartbeat
Singapore heartbeat
