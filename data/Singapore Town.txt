<VERSE>
You could take a little trip around Singapore town
In a Singapore city bus
To see Collyer Quay and Raffles Place
The Esplanade and all of us

<CHORUS>
Because in Singapore, Singapore
Their hearts are big and wide you'll find
Because in Singapore, Singapore
You'll find happiness for everyone

<VERSE>
Let's go down to the riverside, 
it's an unforgettable sight
To see the sunrise on a faraway isle, 
turning darkness into light

<CHORUS>
Because in Singapore, Singapore
Their hearts are big and wide you'll find
Because in Singapore, Singapore
You'll find happiness for everyone

<VERSE>
The buildings are climbing 
all the way to the sky
And there's a hundred other people who are striving
For people like you and I

<CHORUS>
Because in Singapore, Singapore
Their hearts are big and wide you'll find
Because in Singapore, Singapore
You'll find happiness for everyone
