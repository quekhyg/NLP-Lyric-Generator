We are voices from the heart 
Singing loud we'll do our part 
Working for ourselves and for the family
Do our best whenever we can
We will help our fellow man
We are happy people living hand in hand

<CHORUS>
Life is simple
Life is free
Life is joy and harmony
We will strive each day
Be the best that we can be
Growing stronger every day we'll make it
You and me we'll work together 
Hand in hand in joy and harmony
