<VERSE>
It's now a quarter of a century
We have worked so hard now just to be free
Through all the heartaches and the pains
We have stood through all the many many changes
In our hearts we have become like family
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, ooh

<VERSE>
We have only what we have in our hands
And in our hearts we've given what we can
It'll take some time to understand
All the things we slowly have become
But for now I know we'll really really smile
When we say When we say hey

<CHORUS>
I love Singapore
I love Singapore
I love Singapore
Singapore I love you I love you and so much more

<VERSE>
As people we have tried beyond ourselves
It's written on our faces, can't you tell
Through all the heartaches and the pains
We have stood through all the many many changes
In our hearts we have become like family
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, ooh

<CHORUS>
I love Singapore
I love Singapore
I love Singapore
Singapore I love you I love you and so much more
