<VERSE>
Morning comes around and I
Can't wait to see my sunny island
In its glorious greenery
Whether rain or shine it's still beautiful
Bright lights shine on the streets at night
Guiding me closer to home
To a place where I'll be safe and warm
Where I belong
Friends and families by my side
Seeing me through as I grow and learn
Everyday's experience
Bitter sweet or sour they are still wonderful
As they become precious memories
They'll be kept close to my heart
And no matter where I am I will always know
Where I belong

<CHORUS>
Where I belong
Where I keep my heart and soul
Where dreams come true for us
Where we walk together hand in hand
Towards a future so bright
Where I belong
Where I keep my heart and soul
Where we are one big family
I want the whole world to know
I want to shout it out loud
That this is where I know I belong

<CHORUS>
Where I belong
Where I keep my heart and soul
Where dreams come true for us
Where we walk together hand in hand
Towards a future so bright
Where I belong
Where I keep my heart and soul
Where we are one big family
I want the whole world to know
I want to shout it out loud
That this is where I know I belong
