<VERSE>
The moment when I was born
Into this world, into my home
I recall when I was young
Stars and crescent shine on me
In my heart lies my homeland
I share this joy with my families and friends
Let our strength build on and on
Reaching out to the world

<CHORUS>
Stars and crescent shine on me
Make us more than what we can be
All our dreams come true
As we all grow stronger
Stars and crescent shine on me
Turning our hopes into reality
For we will always be
Shining as one

<VERSE>
Let our hopes lead us afar
Into the world, to be the best
There's so much to reach out for
Stars and crescent shining on
In my heart lies my homeland
I share this joy with my families and friends
Stepping out into a new world
As we make our choices

<CHORUS>
Stars and crescent shine on me
Make us more than what we can be
All our dreams come true
As we all grow stronger
Stars and crescent shine on me
Turning our hopes into reality
For we will always be
Shining as one

<CHORUS>
Stars and crescent shine on me
Make us more than what we can be
All our dreams come true
As we all grow stronger
Stars and crescent shine on me
Turning our hopes into reality
For we will always be
Shining as one
