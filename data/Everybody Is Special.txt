<VERSE>
I share this thought with everyone
Escape your ordinary world
Reach out your hand to others and
Your dreams will live
They'll be unfurled

<CHORUS>
Everybody is special
I hope that you will see
We all have hidden dimensions
Just have to set them free
Everybody is special
A spark in everyone
It bursts to life with you
You and me

<VERSE>
I share this thought with everyone
It's a blessing in my life
Take courage
You can hold your own
Break out and stop asking why

<CHORUS>
Everybody is special
I hope that you will see
We all have hidden dimensions
Just have to set them free
Everybody is special
A spark in everyone
It bursts to life with you
You and me

<BRIDGE>
Touch your heart and feel the spirit in your soul
Feel the love inside your heart
Touch your heart and feel the spirit make you whole

<CHORUS>
Everybody is special
I hope that you will see
We all have hidden dimensions
Just have to set them free
Everybody is special
A spark in everyone
It bursts to life with you
You and me
