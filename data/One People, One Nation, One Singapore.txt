<VERSE>
We've built a nation with our hands
The toil of people from a dozen lands
Strangers when we first began, now we're Singaporean
Let's reach out for Singapore, join our hands forevermore

<CHORUS>
One people, one nation, one Singapore
That's the way that we will be forevermore
Every creed and every race, has its role and has its place
One people, one nation, one Singapore

<VERSE>
And when the time comes for the test
Our vigilance will never rest
We'll be united, hand in hand
We'll show the world just where we stand
And reach out for Singapore, join our hands forevermore

<CHORUS>
One people, one nation, one Singapore
That's the way that we will be forevermore
Every creed and every race, has its role and has its place
One people, one nation, one Singapore

<CHORUS>
One people, one nation, one Singapore
That's the way that we will be forevermore
Every creed and every race, has its role and has its place
One people, one nation, one Singapore
One people, one nation, one Singapore
