<VERSE>
I have a dream of starting a life
I have a hope, a flame alight
This is the moment, freedom is calling
This is my start, a new beginning

<VERSE>
I have a heart, it beats for you
A step at a time, our spirits renew
Living together under the sun
Our hearts will beat as one
As one

<CHORUS>
In a heartbeat, I'll be there for you
In a heartbeat, no one else will do
In a heartbeat, we will always be
Together, united, you and me
In a heartbeat, time has passed us by
In a heartbeat, we will reach the sky
In a heartbeat, this will always be
Our people, our country, this is our family


<BRIDGE>
Nothing will stand in our way
We can be strong today
The flame is alive, this is our life

<CHORUS>
In a heartbeat, I'll be there for you
In a heartbeat, no one else will do
In a heartbeat, we will always be
Together, united, you and me
In a heartbeat, time has passed us by
In a heartbeat, we will reach the sky
This will always be
Our people, our country, this is our family
