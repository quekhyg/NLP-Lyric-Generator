<PRELUDE>
I will be here
Right by your side, here
I will hold near
All that we love so dear
Not looking elsewhere
My life is here to share
Just want to show I care

<VERSE>
I know we just got started
And I'm excited
It may not seem all perfect
But you know what?
Our story's just beginnin'
I'm gonna give it my all
Oh yea

<PRECHORUS>
Together we can reach for the stars
Together we are stronger as one
Together we'll make dreams come true
Together sharing the love with all that we do

<CHORUS>
Let our hearts sing
Whoa oh oh oh 
Wooh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh 
Wooh oh oh oh oh
Together
Together as one
We're so much more
One Singapore 

<CHORUS>
Whoa oh oh oh 
Wooh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh 
Wooh oh oh oh oh
Together
Together as one
We're so much more
One Singapore

<VERSE>
It seems like so long ago
When we got started
We wanted everything right
But you know what
Our story keeps on going
We'll give it our all

<PRECHORUS>
Together we can reach for the stars
Together we are stronger as one
Together we'll make dreams come true
Together sharing the love with all that we do

<OTHERS>
Yo! I may look like I'm just a tiny thing
Here I am, I can bravely sing
For sure I'm gonna give you my everything
Like how I play when that recess bell rings
I'm gonna give it my all
Cos this is my home
I love I love I love I love my Singapore

<CHORUS>
Let our hearts sing
Whoa oh oh oh 
Wooh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh 
Wooh oh oh oh oh
Together
Together as one
We're so much more
One Singapore 

<BRIDGE>
Let's join up the dots
Light up this spot
That we call home
Many memories and stories
to be shared
Like the colours of the
rainbow we will shine 
ever so bright
Together we shine
Together we shine

<CHORUS>
Let our hearts sing
Whoa oh oh oh 
Wooh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh 
Wooh oh oh oh oh
Together
Together as one
We're so much more
One Singapore 

<CHORUS>
Whoa oh oh oh 
Wooh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh 
Wooh oh oh oh oh
Together
Together as one
We're so much more
We're so much more
Together
One Singapore
