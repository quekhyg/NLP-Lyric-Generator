<VERSE>
Step by step Together we'll build our dreams
Heart to heart Together we'll stay as one nation, undivided 
Back to back Together we'll brave the heat, the cold, the storms
Hand in hand Together we'll grow this land that we call home

<CHORUS>
Nothing in this world compares
It's our Singaporean Life
Everyone is family, friend and neighbour
Living in harmony
Nothing in this world compares
To this island where it's home
Where we love and know
we'll never be alone
Because it's Singapore
