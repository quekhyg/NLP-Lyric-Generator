<VERSE>
This is my home
She's everything to me
Grace and beauty
In all that you see

<VERSE>
My island home
Wherever I may be
I never will forget her
Nor will she forget me

<CHORUS>
And I will sing
A song of home
A land of peace
Where dreams are born everyday
My home
Wherever I may be
I believe
You will always be a part of me 

<VERSE>
My island home
Home of my family
This is my future
Where I want to be

<CHORUS>
And I will sing
A song of home
A land of peace
Where dreams are born everyday
My home
Wherever I may be
I believe
You will always be a part of me

<CHORUS>
And I will sing
A song of home
A land of peace
Where dreams are born everyday
My home
Wherever I may be
I believe
You will always be a part of me

<CHORUS>
My home
Wherever I may be
I believe
You will always be a part of me
A part of me
