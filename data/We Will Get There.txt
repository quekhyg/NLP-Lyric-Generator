<VERSE>
Remember the days, 
we set out together with faith
Remember the times so fine when we thought that
Nothing could stand in our way
Then things weren't the same
The life that we knew had to change
We've struggled through the darkest storms
We thought we couldn't tame

<BRIDGE>
Together we've tried,
As we stood side by side
I knew we'd build a new world
A world of hope for ever after

<CHORUS>
Deep in my heart I just know,
Right from the start we will grow
Look where we are we've come so far
And there's still a long long way to go
With all of my heart I will care
I'll play my part I will share
With family and friends together we'll stand
And in the end hand in hand
We will get there

<VERSE>
So now we begin working together to win
Believing in trust it must
Be possible to overcome anything.
There's so much to do
There's so much we can contribute
By sharing just a little love
We will start again anew

<BRIDGE>
So why don't we try? If we stand side by side
I know we'll build a new world
A world of hope for ever after

<CHORUS>
Deep in my heart I just know,
Right from the start we will grow
Look where we are we've come so far
And there's still a long long way to go
With all of my heart I will care
I'll play my part I will share
With family and friends together we'll stand
And in the end hand in hand
We will get there
