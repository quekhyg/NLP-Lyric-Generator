<VERSE>
Have you seen a star,
One that guides you no matter where you are?
However vast the sky may be
Or dark it seems
You can be sure, it's always there for you and me

<VERSE>
Have you heard a song,
One that moved you, one that made you sing along?
Your dreams and hopes will all come true
If you believe that every vision begins with you.

<CHORUS>
Shine for Singapore
This is your song,
Deep inside your heart where it belongs
It'll always stay. Strive for your goals,
You will achieve with visions so bold.

<CHORUS>
Shine for Singapore
This is our song
Reach out for the sky, far and beyond
As one we'll stand, we're Singapore
It's here that we belong
Have you heard a song,
One that moved you, one that made you sing along?
Your dreams and hopes will all come true
If you believe that every vision begins with you.

<CHORUS>
Shine for Singapore
This is your song,
Deep inside your heart where it belongs
It'll always stay. Strive for your goals,
You will achieve with visions so bold.

<CHORUS>
Shine for Singapore
This is our song
Reach out for the sky, far and beyond
As one we'll stand, we're Singapore
It's here that we belong

<BRIDGE>
Nowhere I'd rather be, this is home to me
This star shines strong and free
