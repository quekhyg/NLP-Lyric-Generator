This is a place
You'll be amazed
Where children play
Where best friends stay
Have different tastes
Live different ways
The smile on your face
Can bring us closer every day

<VERSE>
This is a place
Our common space
We share our dreams
One goal we chase
Come join our pace
We'll win the race
When we're together
We can make miracles come our way

<CHORUS>
This is where we'll see
Familiar faces from our neighbourhood
This is where we'll share
The stories dating back to our childhood
It's here where I'll find
Your hand to lift me up
When I fall
It's here where I am sure
I'm safe
I won't be lost

<CHORUS>
This is where we'll stand as one
To build a home for you and me
This is where we'll join our hands
To grow the fruits of harmony
When you and I
Put our hearts together
We'll stand the test
For this is where we belong
We'll give our best

<VERSE>
This is the place
Our common space
We share our dreams
One goal we chase
Come join our pace
We'll win the race
Here's where I belong
Where I know that love is there for me

I'm safe
I won't be lost

This is where we'll join our hands
To grow the fruits of harmony

We're as close as one big family
Here's where I belong
Where my heart will always be
