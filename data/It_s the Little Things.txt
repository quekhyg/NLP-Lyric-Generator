<VERSE>
Over the years, I've grown to be a part of you
You've cared for me and opened the way to a happy and beautiful life
You make me feel warm and safe 
and give me hope for brighter days

<CHORUS>
It's the little things that we share, 
the love and joy that's in the air
The children's laughter everywhere, 
and all our favourite things
It's the little things that we share, 
the love and joy that's in the air
The children's laughter everywhere, 
and all our favourite things
Over the years, 
I've grown accustomed to your ways
And no matter where I'll be, 
it warms my heart 
to know that You're always here for me

<CHORUS>
It's the little things that we share, 
the love and joy that's in the air
The children's laughter everywhere, 
and all our favourite things
It's the little things that we share, 
the love and joy that's in the air
The children's laughter everywhere, 
and all our favourite things
Over the years, 
I've learnt we share a destiny
And no matter how good others may be
No one cares like you care for me

<OTHERS>
Cause deep down inside I feel you're a part of me
My Singapore, the place that I call my Home
