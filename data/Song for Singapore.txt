<VERSE>
It's a brand new day a brand new story
I remembered the way it used to be
We've come so far
You're my history you're my beginning
In all I've done I've been nurtured in your arms
And you carried me this far

<CHORUS>
I want to sing
Sing a song for Singapore
With every generation there's more to be grateful for
So come and sing
Sing a song for Singapore
You're my brother you're my sister
I'm thankful for my Singapore
My Singapore
Singapore

<VERSE>
Come together everybody
Fly the flag and share our story
Live our wildest dreams
Celebrate the red and white
The moon and stars in harmony unite
Let every colour every heart

<CHORUS>
Come on and sing
Sing a song for Singapore
With every generation there's more to be grateful for
So come and sing
Sing a song for Singapore
You're my brother you're my sister
I'm thankful for my Singapore
My Singapore
Singapore

<BRIDGE>
We've had our ups and downs
Sometimes the best things are taken for granted
You're my family you're my home

<CHORUS>
I want to sing
Sing a song for Singapore
With every generation there's more to be grateful for
So come and sing
Sing a song for Singapore
You're my brother you're my sister
I'm thankful for my Singapore
My Singapore
Singapore
