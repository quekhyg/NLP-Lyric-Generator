<VERSE>
There's a part for everyone
In this land where we belong
There's a part for one and all
To keep the peace we want
Though not all will carry arms
To help defend our land
We must all do what we can
Together hand in hand

<CHORUS>
Put your heart, your mind, your skill to our defence
Put your heart, your mind, your skill to our defence
Put your art, your work and will 
To the defence of Singapore
Put your heart, your mind, your skill to our defence

<VERSE>
We have sailors
We have airmen
We have soldiers brave and good men
Trained and ready
Strong and steady
Help them all to help us all
There's a part for everyone
In the course we're set upon
Work together with a will
And we'll do what must be done

<CHORUS>
Put your heart, your mind, your skill to our defence
Put your heart, your mind, your skill to our defence
Put your art, your work and will 
To the defence of Singapore
Put your heart, your mind, your skill to our defence
