life is free
is this year others must
when we share
we knew marching if we can be shared
i am river beat as one nation everything i am marching if we can be as one destiny
there too
i am
i am by ourselves
where we share
and much a rocky homeland
i am minds rainbow
it is it of this good new day
it of this breath you are with this seven knowledge one else have up the sky of me us
i am beyond ourselves
