out of the stormy sea
our home our heart our singapore
oh oh 
wooh a kai yet still i long to see my dreams take flight in singapore
this city
this is where this family's family
this is from
to be shared
the store by
you've never seen that island
this is empty
this is for me
just don't you think it
come let's go and share just silly
let's with some story
singaporean style an airport
that'll raffles town into world
there're simple
one drop in unity
what do

with one man
we could set out there will rise as well
a brand new every day
