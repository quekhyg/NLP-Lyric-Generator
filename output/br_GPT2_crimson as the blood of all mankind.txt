crimson as the blood of all mankind
it's a brand new day in our days
we always knew had to change us and we'd be constantly -you'll always stay strive for your goals
you will with visions so much more
together we can be sure

singapura oh singsunny island set in the sea
the lays ukata (pretty flowers bloom for you are not alone
always ready to see them
as they must always remain
make us undivided on sunny beaches too often by your shore
because it'senest place
may the occasions outcasts every occasion
to achieve
in my people still being prepared to miss
so come from many changes
that these things never failing stars aboveures in their ways<|endoftext|>
