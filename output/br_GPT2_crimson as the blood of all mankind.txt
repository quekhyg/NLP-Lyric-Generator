crimson as the blood of all mankind
there was a time when people said
that singapore won't make it for me
but you know what
our story keeps on
we've kept the flame within reach
now we can find our dreams alive
let's take flight
with wings we soar and reach us far
together hand in hand
one drop in hand we are shining
when we share this land
to treasure right to the core
oh sit beside
just one big lies our family
where i belong
singaporean
come whatever may be
the best
i never rest
it's there be
for peace and nowas long ago

you're here
this is
here's my country
my heart but that bright and safe and safeand full of sunshine
