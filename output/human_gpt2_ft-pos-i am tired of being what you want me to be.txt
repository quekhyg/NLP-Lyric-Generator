<pos> <verse> 
 i am tired of being what you want me to be 
 because of who you are 
 i can be everything i am 
 
 
 <verse> 
 show me how i should be strong 
 teach me that i can be weak 
 speed 
 in any way that i will try 
 that we share 
 with friends and families by dedicated men 
 come from a song for home 
 sake they is where that we own 
 say when that dream 
 hand in hand in hand 
 making one singapore the home 
 back 
 around us all might defend and reap 
 make dreams together 
 let is home 
 hand in hand 
 hand 
 hand in hand 
 hand <chorus> say when we will do not looking forward to a mountain top our strength <chorus> hand in hand 
 let is work for home 
 there is take courage 
 
 with hopes within our strength <chorus> that river grow 
 hand
