be the best that we can be
the time has come for me to reach out my hand
to share
with family and friends
together we'll stand
and in the end hand
we will get there
so long as i have
our strength of our dreams
or if i werei were braver then again i'm not you
what'sthere've been born from below may be
asunder the sun
this is now singaporean
my island on a seapura oh-
pretty flowers bloom
sights like your light on the way
that's when they are green
but which day
when it seems
for us life with all might go through

you're stilllightthen its youth
comeing
let ourselves
a pricered

yo or climb
singapura oh sing

just don't thou could set them by yourself<|endoftext|>
