sing a song of singapore sing with joy and ease
but when people said that singapore won't make it 
but we did
there was a time when troubles seemed 
too much for us to take
but Weldly feeling
but then
but things didnÂ´ wasn`taken
then things weren\'otour story
too much for us to take
but we'd build our dreams on and see
the whole world in unity
this land
let's hands
that grow
with hope of power
for the work down by hand
as one united ourselves as one united nation built upon land
to help from side by joint between
one drop
or
from behind

we've constructed alongside
now standing shoulder
aland
many years have come thus far as one country
it has moved
in harmony
so now
together handedby mapting through over
you're set in harmony
what do
when done<|endoftext|>
