we are the ones with the dreams i ask of sing
sing a song for singapore
with every generation there's more to be grateful for
so come and sing
sing an island in the sea
sing a nation strong and free 

strong and free our citizens united Â no one people as one we can defend thee vot
to build my art in harmony
as one unified <|endoftext|>
