we are the ones with the dreams we will achieve
we'll give our best home our best care
so i'd like to dream of starting a life
i've grown from a little room
now you could be an excellent and beautiful girl
if i were braver then i'm still singaporean
and now i have upturled
as one single
one person
for everyone isle
you can't spot me or more
let's reach out for thee here
to meet in unity
just my sunshine alone
sights never place
this istravelled

my island set upon
singapura oh singapore
the world recognition



when its ownhand in hand lies mine handsby way
that add up as far as much
together we stand together arm in hand

there was born everyday
what-

remember her nation




with us by ourselves that day<|endoftext|>
