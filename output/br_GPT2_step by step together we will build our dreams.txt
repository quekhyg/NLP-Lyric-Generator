step by step together we will build our dreams
just like ours and i've done
there's a time when people said
that singapore won't make it 
but rather
to build my defence of singapore
put your heart your mind your best here every race has its role and has its place
here's to share

let us all
so let ourselves reach out for the skies
we'll join up this spot
with wings we can fall
this is yet still be bright as long as wellas we are nigh around at homegrown
our hearts'oe now in taipei

no way
one drop ooh oh go on
and then
see-
through many years have come from year agowheni love upon
many yearsback there was never before hand lies no matter where we could onlythee<|endoftext|>
