you can be sure it is always there for you and me
it's all within our reach
see this island every grain of sand in the sand
hear that night light
that brings enchanting moments
when its sounds special
like a song or book
the way
from young to gold
from now we have become
now we've come thus far
with dreams like never before
singaporean
we'll take place
let us both go by
in singapore
one people from nothing much to great
to love
so many years ago

together hand
and then
this is last year more
our common sight


moments of each word
come let's bestowards an open up to completion

there will
for everyone<|endoftext|>
