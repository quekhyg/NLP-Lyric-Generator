you can be sure it is always there for you and me
we just don't realise how fortunate we are
sometimes we wonder what our dreams unfold
may the good things that we achieve
be able to see
to understand every day's experience
the place is clean and green in your face
everyday
travelling to ensure daily feeling
it's enjoyment
that all its children's work
sing a sensation everywhere <|endoftext|>
