working for ourselves and for the family
put your heart your mind your skill to our defence
put a day you wait for me
let's go down to read headlines on the news
that's my singaporean
one people one nation one singapore


we are an open today
sans 
a nation strong and country built with our hands
forevermore
this is ours new
to be shared
as we'll
like that night will bring light of magic
