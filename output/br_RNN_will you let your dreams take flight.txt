will you let your dreams take flight
in the world ourselves
that and nights it of this moment our dream
we share
sing our lives streets is a song
we have up your strength and nights our hands
our faces flight in this moment our faces flight in your beautiful moon and nights a song
where where i am friends
together
working sometimes we knew much a times everything to find as one nation
it of this seven seas oh oh oh
here
it is a moon and
i am fine
