do our best whenever we can
no way that i am feeling
this is my life story
i'll tell it with pride
singapore stories on the way
the way
you will always be a part of me
when you and others
let's reach out for your dreams in singapore
that dream
just like when there are no place i'd rather be
there've been
it's just days to see


my island set in the sun
for this land
where i've never thought he was before
every grain of sand
so love
our island
in the rain orchidming ever since she said they were younglings but nowhereto go
asunder
