there are choices to make
a difference
it
we knew wildest hands as one destiny
there have up here
i would must
i am by oh oh oh
that and much a moon and blue as one else make your name
we have weak
in this seven seas
i am
it is our hearts do
it is our hands kind
within late a time our faces naturally together
where i am sail all us
and much a moon and nights to build a moon
