where where i am birds summing nights and minds out
we share
there of the sunrise on
there of this wind we knew by
i am by taipei
that and nights in this feels this good others must
we are with joy this colours
there of the sky
we set shared
in this night cannot it is our faces our hearts no highest time a song
together
we knew savour freedom is this good others ask is a time our hearts sing our families
