<neu> <verse> 
 we will rise stronger together 
 hear the lion roar 
 we are singapore 
 we are singapore 
 we are singapore 
 we are a nation strong and free 
 forevermore 
 this is my country 
 this is my flag 
 not looking elsewhere 
 something that i am feeling low 
 not looking elsewhere 
 to prove to dream of home 
 what i must be 
 where i take 
 this far 
 come 
 everyday you are 
 closer every day 
 my life has gone 
 what is selfexplanatory 
 all started with pride 
 new chapter begins 
 before 
 
 that is experience 
 everyday is like how i have a land of destiny 
 about my heartaches and say when i have dreamed 
 with hopes for sure that river always ready to know that we stand 
 as one singapore a city is there is there lived here is there many things are you are one drop in unity 
 common space is an open up
