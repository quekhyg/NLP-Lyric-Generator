your dreams and hopes will all come true
paradise
i am minds out of me
in the same
it is this precious around this moment our families
it is a difference
it of this moment our faces collyer quay we knew sometimes else grow
it is together
here
it of me strong and hard words unfurled
close as
there of me our faces collyer quay and much a brand new ways
i am minds danced as with
where it is our faces flight
where we share
you
