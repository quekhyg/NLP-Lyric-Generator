<neu> <verse> 
 feeling so faithless lost under the surface 
 it is then i remember 
 what my heart always knew 
 
 <chorus> 
 you are my story 
 is selfexplanatory 
 will write a song of home 
 where i share 
 with friends and families and families 
 come 
 whoa oh a land of friends 
 time will remain 
 time will stay 
 have hidden dimensions 
 have hidden 
 strength in unity 
 
 building on going 
 borders 
 together we will stand 
 together we will stand 
 for peace and stand 
 together 
 together 
 let is home 
 common destiny 
 walls are gonna stand 
 common destiny 
 for home <others again 
 <bridge> together we will stand 
 <prechorus> together we will make dreams out 
 
 
 sense of home 
 in hand in unity
