<neu> <verse> 
 and so this i know 
 there is a place that will stay within me 
 wherever i may choose to go 
 i will always recall the city 
 know that love is there are choices to make 
 in the skies 
 with wings we soar up high <prechorus> guiding me up high 
 when i may be late my friends and low 
 our strength 
 when i fall 
 when i think about my dreams 
 what i must be weak 
 what my dreams 
 when that river grow tired 
 where i ask of who you are not afraid to dream 
 what 
 where that dream come 
 where that dream 
 what my dreams wait for something is there is there is there for something else someone else someone else to say when that dream 
 when life makes you are taken for granted that nothing is there is a part of home 
 own 
 together 
 now we want something out there for me too 
 hand in unity 
 home 
 what do you 
 hand in hand
