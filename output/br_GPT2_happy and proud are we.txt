happy and proud are we singapore 
we've had our ups and downs
sometimes the best things aren't all perfect
the life that we knew had to change
we've struggled through its darkest storms
we thought we couldní'd weren´
what's there to do
but you're feeling when youre hadn`'t always here before
and it felt this right from the start
our dreams we will grow
look where we've come so far
look around at us and I've just a nation<|endoftext|>
