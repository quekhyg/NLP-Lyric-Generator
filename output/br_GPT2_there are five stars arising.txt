there are five stars arising from one river which we walk
this is where i know it's home
for this iswhere my dreams wait for me
where that river always flows
this is home surely
as my senses tell you: This island every grain of sand
this is fresh and light
that green in color
when it feels this right
you see the plays
it makes your mood grow brighter when it works toward a quarter of an open book






the day awaits


my heart each has passed by
in its side here<|endoftext|>
