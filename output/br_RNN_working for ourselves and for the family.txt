working for ourselves and for the family
that and much more
it is our families
in the world
in this breath city cake
i am by
we knew though what we are much more
there of this year others have wide faces flight and much a song
i am
together
we knew true
where it is this moment our faces pride
it is our faces collyer quay and nights and proud knew equality
i would belong
together
there is our families
together as one
