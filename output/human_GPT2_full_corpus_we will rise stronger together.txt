we will rise stronger together
together we make a difference 
our friends our families
we will share a special dream
together we feel the singapore heartbeat of magic

together we keep it from here that we call home
let us find in ourselves and understand
that everything is there for one destiny
with a smile on our faces can't you to stay
in all those places so far off
and beyond
a nation

not alone

singaporeans everywhere at your heart

it's too much more than people like this right by our side here that we welcome everyone to treasure right away
this is my life with you come let's take a walk down
i'm out into a stroll ahead as long to the road which brings us brave journey awaits
as three along
to every has gone before the mark
you'll always there's been made sure

if you



be shared memories put us to share
any but kept coming up to share
when someone else won't you
all within our own
for anyone seen
here i know just a part for me

of a new beginning
