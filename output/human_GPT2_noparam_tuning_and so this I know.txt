and so this I know
right from the start we will grow as one nation 
look where we've come so far together 
our common destiny
we're singaporean life
one family friend and neighbour
i share that joy with my families too
it's all grew up in the past decade 
so i've grown old ago
but no matter when they died
no matter what 
just facts or love nor race nor religion
nor race nor religion or religionthey are ever united people who may choose to stay within our hands
to build a century
do it'll always recall us forever
still remembering
remember the future generations
singap their heritage
when faced down memory
seen faces
come on
seeing still remain
never change its right by sharing truthside
yet the road
yes face
always ready
their hand in any longer
tell them are kept striving for life story
learned
that day
nothing changed<|endoftext|>
