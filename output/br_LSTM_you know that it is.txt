you know that it is
home especially reach are reaching out begins living
there is my heart grew land i will you make to go housings singapore me knew like you have to close work oh oh and dream
where i arms big the way to the world streams memory lane happen
river see each star we have down
i have to be singapore
where i new life you know we have sister singing magic is my home other one
to one people our dream steady in the stories aloud
i will make always pretty ordinary things and
