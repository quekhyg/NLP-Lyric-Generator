life is simple
when it feels this right
you know that it's 
love at first light
the voices of our friends
come whatever â€”
on the road ahead
we did it before
and we'll do it again
just like they've done before
our home
hand to the defence of singapore
put your heart
let us down go and put a handanism into my mindyour work for ourselvesself
like an artist on the world map
oh can't you see oh ole when its time has no place
to change hands in hand
together hand
with me
here are precious as oneothery
in-see wonder howling
that add up all
so I'm feeling
forteacher taught there willlest toastfullyas someone from year have come through
