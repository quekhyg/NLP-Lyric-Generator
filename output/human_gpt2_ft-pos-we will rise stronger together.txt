 we will rise stronger together 
 ready to meet the bright new day 
 so much to look forward to 
 
 i <prechorus> 
 together we can 
 together we can reach for peace and full of green 
 where the stars 
 where the future is an open book 
 together 
 hand in hand 
 hand in hand 
 
 <chorus> hand in hand

 together we are one singapura oh a song of homely feeling low 
 <chorus> <chorus> <chorus> together we are one drop in a song of home 
 <chorus> together we are stronger as one people one foot by second a land of home
