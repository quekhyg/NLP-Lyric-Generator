we remain undivided our hearts in harmony
to grow the fruits of harmony i will sing
a song of home
for you are here
i want to hear your voice
my dreams with every generation there
just my thoughts and no plans
what do you can't spot
come whatever 
there's no matter where i am 
you know when it is or may go
when its storymsights into the sky
this is full
our dream on

that we'll look around us upand reach for inspiration
with all might come from each other people who<|endoftext|>
