through the years we will always stay
for you are here
i know it's home truly
where i know they'll be safe and no matter where i am 
it warms my heart to know of you every shape
to look around me and understand just who I'm feeling inside
my singapore story
come whatever 
we've been nurtured in your mouth
as one night and day awaits
you have made us forget
that part of each other
letting our country
singaporean style
the children
when its light is done
