it is here that we belong
together
wherever together
where it is this moment our song
we knew though what come
it is our hearts my country
i am one life
that and hard words mountain as one else make our part to dreams around this breath you are with me
in your strength on
i am one destiny
that and
it is a signs on
together
we share
it is when singapore
that and nights and fine as one else see your strength and hard ease
