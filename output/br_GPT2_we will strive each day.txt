we will strive each day
as one united people
for singapore and nation
let's reach out for our hands forevermore
one man on an island
in a heartbeat no way that we can fall
by the hand
whata oh 
ourselves may be
but through it is written upon our shore
it's still shines bright in the sun
with green of your morning
when its lights i seethis is gone
the moonsets at your heart
you are shining bright aloneturning anew
that shine

together you with me
