hand in hand in joy and harmony
this is my future  I can be everything i am capable
to make me more than what i can be
all our dreams come true memories put your days ahead
as we will bring for us to see
we have hidden dimensions
just have to hold near the world to understand
everybody in our strides <|endoftext|>
