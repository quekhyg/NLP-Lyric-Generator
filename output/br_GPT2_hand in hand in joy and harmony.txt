hand in hand in joy and harmony
when you are there for me
my singapore story
i'll write it with pride
you've my people too i'd rather be here
your dreams can live together
just your life style a tiny one big family
then the way that we will start from underage
here's
this is to every day

the whole world will read of us by our side

that night
we could set forth each day

see all weathersights & every grain of our country on an island
let't even though its light
come let's still shine alonean town<|endoftext|>
