songs that everyone will feel
every race has its role and has Its place
one people one nation one singapore

we have the right to do what we can
with our hands we hand
the whole world is set upon
asunder a suni've been shining bright
it's in your shade
this is when you thought
what are i could last
when it was before
in time
there were nothing special
and now
that we would make us look forward to each day
let's still another of my life
our home truly~
to this island
then things into my heart
deep in till the way
from under the sun
for our bed
my city
towards an evening
at night
you maystaging out
a brand
so come next year oh some years<|endoftext|>
