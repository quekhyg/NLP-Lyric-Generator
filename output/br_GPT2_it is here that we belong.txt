it is here that we belong
where i know it's homeright from your heart
touch your heart and feel the spirit make you whole
i can't wait to see ooh a nation with its glorious greenery
in its light singapore singapore
that add up to my senses
my island set me free
a style singaporean of our own
now an open book
to read headlines on the way
this is one could not only thing
as they're written



so much as far as it seems
