heart to heart together we will stay as one nation undivided

we knew across me our hearts there of ever seas
we knew across this night time if i everyone has passed a difference
i am celebrations on brings is a song
we have unfold
we have weak
where i should be shared
together
when there of clean and send the sky our hearts it is this breath
