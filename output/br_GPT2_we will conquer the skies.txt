we will conquer the skies and sail the seas
to be where i wanna be as my senses tell me
this is where i won't be alone
for this is where i know it's home

where we share our dreams
moments of magic
time brings new hopes for us to see
a brand with everyone
there are still progressing
we have grown stronger memories put in our hands
new hope for us to see
the world bynow we've become like family
nothing in time has come true
it's more
stars
that you'll always there for us
just singapore
so now beyond all those times will always stay
times comes out through
in every day and morning feeling changesif we feel a lamp
everybody in our pace
you're too far together
when we make sense<|endoftext|>
