and turn it from a place
one people one nation one singapore

so as to build our home the best possible world
to carry on the dream of starting with all that we do
when you know just my life story
this last forever

come let's reach out for your hand someone join our pace
we'll make a difference
let us closer than love
for us up stand down pat
tomorrow
