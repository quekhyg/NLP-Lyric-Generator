delightful nights and days
the whole world will know
let's reach out for our hands with wings we soar up high
our dreams we'll all achieve
we'll make our destiny
let's reach out for the skies
with wings we can climb as well as one hand
to help defend our dream in singapore
in my heart lies that place where i love
one manhood
that honor me & joy of others
this is mine<|endoftext|>
