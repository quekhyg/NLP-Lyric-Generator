delightful nights and days
it's the little things that we share 

the love and joy that in our hearts
time brings in my life
life is mine
nothing in this world compares
to this island where it's home
where we love and know
we'll stand as one city
and grow stronger
stars unfold for sing of hope & peace
so come true
let us to see
what a day
morning feeling
when you say
turning signs on an island set out into a song by a lamp so faraway shore
everybody
you're calling call
that made up ahead
moments of magic
many memories put together with many changes
in your name
for all might't be done
stam style in place
not looking abroad
this is not seen something new<|endoftext|>
