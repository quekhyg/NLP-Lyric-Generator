life is free
the expression
this is my family 

these are my friends
we have families with us
singing singaporean style in unity

you can hardly spot our island on the world map
yet still people of note
what a singerapore songapore
you could scarcely spot ourselves as one nation



there's no place i'd rather be




one dropin this land to call home

one manon the world map







see it's then at your side byside and share

a price
every grain of sand
the colour every race has its own
the love
to help defend
that's enjoyment

so now life that's barely will make you see any money

come let's take
nowhere's wait to go


it'll miss you
our lives here
no matterwhen
just don't care



let's just look around town


your smilescan't even start from last



and reach out for me






together we've come today


put an emptyas long after
like never else there're oh journey

between these
