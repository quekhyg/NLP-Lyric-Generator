i am tired of being what you want me to be
and even though i've roamed the world
it's still my home i long to see
this is where this is family
for families and our friends
let's keep it that we are
when there'll be a way to start anew
till it feels this right

there're no place for me when things aren't all ready to meet
to reach out
that's depths

just like these good things never end
so make some land
wherever hand in hand
