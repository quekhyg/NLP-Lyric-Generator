i am tired of being what you want me to be
when we meet
will he recognise me too
river won't make my dream come true
and if i continue as one
together hand in hand
for all those that day
make us all the best things possible for singapore
we can achieve together heart
be where we walk together hand in hand
be able to reach out our dreams

we can achieve peace

let it is done before 
you and i should achieve

there's written on by sharing just a little love
so long way ourselves
just believe

a nation this island wide



that will grow stronger every day there'll always stay with you<|endoftext|>
