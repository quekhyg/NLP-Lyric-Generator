together singapore singapore
where i am family
we set crystals in this precious around the sky of who tell
i am start jewel
that and nights it is a spring oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
i am by
that and far together
what something new wind we knew across this shine dating back
there have wide ways
no years friends
we knew united as one destiny
there for me
when i am hollywood will find weak
we slowly ways
there is there
