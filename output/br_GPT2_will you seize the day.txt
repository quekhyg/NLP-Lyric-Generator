will you seize the day
you are my brother you're sisteri'm thankful for and i am grateful for your singapore
my island home
wherever i may be
i never will forget her shore
nor miss her flowers nor grow old with me
look to my neighbours in san francis
that's
in its ways we have grown
now we share our dreams of coffee
the love
there've been nurtured in your beautiful island in your face one drop
your light
when it feels this moment
but then i remember when it feels this right
together we stand together
together hand
our dream
for us all
let ourselves every night
singing each other a city<|endoftext|>
