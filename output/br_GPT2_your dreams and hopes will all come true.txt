your dreams and hopes will all come true
if you believe that every vision begins with you
deep in your heart where i just know

it's always darkest just before the dawn
we share our dreams
moments of magic we memories
one special dream
time will bring for us to see
a brand new hope on those wishing things<|endoftext|>
