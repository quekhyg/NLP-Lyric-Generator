your dreams and hopes will all come true
as we live together
together sharing the love with all that i am
singapore story
i've walked in spain danced in taipei
it's grown into a nation of our own
there've been days of laughter and pain
but family by your side here
this is my homeland
you're still beautiful
every grain of sand
the voices of sand
come whatever 
the clouds you pleaseapura oh singaporean
on the song
in bloom
our island set them sweet island
when it's green
that's light rolls
just like this spot makes ya bright


whata spark
turning
where i sit besidehome
my dream awaythen its lights up to me
make us more than everyday
sights on
and wonderful
let's cooking or climb the moon
like hummingyeah go on
now standing proud
whoa style
here's then home
if i might take flight
yo maybetake a little things never change
we are people too
remember so much less
to make me
