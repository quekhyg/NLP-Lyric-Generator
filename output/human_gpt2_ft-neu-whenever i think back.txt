<neu> <verse> 
 whenever i think back 
 i am feeling low 
 i look around me and i know 
 there is a place that will stay within me 
 wherever i may choose to go 
 i will always know 
 i must be 
 where i belong 
 where i will share 
 
 where that river always flows 
 this is home 
 
 
 where i belong 
 
 this is home is where i know that recess bell rings 
 
 as one drop in the morning comes for you are not afraid to see them that little things were not fair 
 here together 
 together with friends and share 
 together 
 together with friends and families and families by second light 
 together we will 
 saying when that day dawns again 
 
 together with faith 
 
 whispering on the strength build a song in unity is gone 
 sense thats dream 
 together we are stronger as one singapore our dreams come true for sure there is where that nothing changed
