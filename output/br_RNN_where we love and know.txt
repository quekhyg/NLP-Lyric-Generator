where we love and know
together
it of hope ways
together
where there have brings bridge
i am
and ease
we set shared
it of me the pains oh
together
we can have weak
it is it is it seems and ease
we have up our life
together
here
it is a song for me our friends
together
we knew families
we knew everything and minds out of me our faces freedom is a fruits of me
it of the sky
together
