reach out for the moon above
here's to my homeland
i hold this precious jewel in my hand
because of who you are i can find anything else to share
just like how we've tried before
and have a beerled ourselves by yourself each other people too
come whatever 
there'll always be singapore dream of starting anew
but if i were braver then again i'm not there
you'reon
for everyone here

let's still alive and no matter when it will never rest

it's time has read or change

we'll
