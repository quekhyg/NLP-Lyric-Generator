there is a part for everyone
i have seas truth let every place
deep dreams i tired tomorrow is my heart our where i could your heart tomorrow
i have faraway reach nothing brings will teach life for the independence
i may way
though they face in the destiny
i can the way to the single exercise old action
i was
the singapore
if we will reach out for the years we will be things not hope bursts to be family
i have to the sea
and
you are hearts all
