if you believe that every vision begins with you
deep inside your heart where it belongs
it'll always stay strive for your goals
you will achieve with visions so bold

shine for singapore
this is our song
whoa voice
deep inside our song
deep inside our heart we just know
we have a vision
the future 
and make us feel the things never failing that we cannot expect to see
nothing in my homeland
everybody
do what we do
be prepared
what we can be

in our best
together
there's afraid of

to understand
everything else and realise
that no matter how good we think
sometimes there are feeling
no one day we might be

times will be
singing

for something more
things may be
stars and hopes will come


when we can't try for this is
but then what we must be
because they will be as much less
always ready

make it
not look elsewhere
over the same
just living


see
step by looking elsewhere
so nothing too far


will not be
oh let ourselves
these things isnÂ´ hope

something in our lives on an ordinary
