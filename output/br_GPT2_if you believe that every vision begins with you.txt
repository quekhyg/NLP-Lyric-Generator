if you believe that every vision begins with you
you are who i am 
i can find anything i seek
here's to your defence and me
for people of the future
remember the times so fine?
when they said we're singapore
my dream'd
we've built a world in spain danced in taipei
with our way when it was still beautiful
the time
it's then again thought no one other
but us but ourselves
to build my life together as close as one united hand
as one
let eachother could
together hand
that let others go
from young or from now on top by myself
then things between oneself
there'll be put into years ago
just what tomorrow is this land
and finally beyond our hands
until today
in an open bookless different set upon
whata price'don justone man
this is paid
whereupon saleputtingof course
so much more
our home
like before
