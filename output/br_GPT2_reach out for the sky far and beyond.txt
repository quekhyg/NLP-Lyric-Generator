reach out for the sky far and beyond
with wings we soar up high y in tai yet still dont't seem all that much more

see this island 
every grain of sand
hear these sounds every grain of green at your breakfast
the day
that's my dreams light up when they fall
look it around me down
my singaporean
songs of our country
singing wonder how to-time
that'll make us take on
to build a nation with pride


just like never done before
oh oh by ourselves



together hand




so come from people, lands as close ties and across the defence

soas one united under arms



for peace and now as one arm
putting through
this isfrom years ago
letis shared




one drop in the hands newspain'd here today


and finally again




a priceredunder the sun
our faces ever after
we've built together as well as long have its shores between can reach

now standing proudly
it's
whenever since independence<|endoftext|>
