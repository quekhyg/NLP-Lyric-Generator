there is a new moon arising
from where we have come thus far
look around at our faces 
they shine brightly in the sun
with one drop in my step
look it's then i remember first light and feel this moment
when it feels this right
you know that it always will be time
our people said there was an earthquake
and you were lost
for us to make dreams of our life
let'tah when we've hadto take on a mountain
in-
together hand

theses
of ourselves too much for me
so love
