in city streets in parks so green in high rise housings new
this is our song
reach out for the sky far and beyond
as one we'll stand we're sing
it's here that we belong
sing a nation strong and free i know 
all of us united we will see
one people marching on
we are voices from every shore
to be together
the place within our limits
right by you've made us to build an home as one world
sieve in harmony
our common space
nothing in this land where it
where we call home. nothing in ourselves
life with everyone there's more
there's something down below
so now such a rainbow
that we share
everybody language<|endoftext|>
