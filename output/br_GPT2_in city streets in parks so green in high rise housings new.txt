in city streets in parks so green in high rise housings new hopes into reality
as we prospered through the ages
we'll have worked even though the rain and still shine when the year's last light
oh to hours of laughter
the day a century our poor work for home



this is my family 




together united hand to foot
to lift up with me uphand
our dreams unfold every night

that shed i take
of us by that day each other





let ourselves reach out therefor families or dropcome on<|endoftext|>
