aspire to achieve
may the good things that we can be
be
no one in this world compares
it's our singaporean life
everyone is family friend and neighbour
living in harmony
nothing in this world compares
to a country of ours
where it's own
everybody
what you're feeling inside your ordinary experience
the place where everyone living here
we share
meeting colleagues will observe my island set them free <|endoftext|>
