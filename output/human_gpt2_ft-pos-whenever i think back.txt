<pos> <verse>
whenever i think back
i like to dream of things i would have done
if i were braver then again i am not
what is there to do
maybe if i had another chance
i would have another chance
i would go into my past
with my past
where i would have a life
and share
making my life a book
with friends and families and families
so much more than what we share
home
home
together
together as one singapore story to show me how i care
just like that you are always will he is necessary
like we share
everyday
just where that we stand
home is about its people too
the love inside your strength

second light
hand in unity
using the world which brings us all the garden always ready to treasure right roads ahead
hand
together we want to set them that nothing is selfexplanade and slow to home
