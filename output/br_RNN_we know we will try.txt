we know we will try

it is to grow your faces collyer quay and defending
here
it is a song
together
to miss as much a moon and nights on our hands forevermore
we can be weak
we knew marching if we knew though what it is this precious around this moment our hearts we knew families
we knew by
in the sky of this moment our hands forevermore
we are with each day
there is this since new moon and neighbour
we knew time brings dawns as one else
