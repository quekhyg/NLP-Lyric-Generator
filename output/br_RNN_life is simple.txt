life is simple
do
by past
we are by
that and
there of me the road you are by
there of me us
together
we knew hour
i am lies a thousand sky too
in the sky of everyone
i am one destiny
it is a moon and tears
there of ever seas
there for me the moon and much a moon and much brings is it is our strides ourselves by
i am by
there for me nothing lend a difference
