whenever I think back
look it's the voices of our friends
come whatever 
on the road ahead
we did it before 
and we'll do it again
when the moments turn to hours
and reached
that day becomes precious
my life with me
this is my family
to know just a story
every grain of you every race has its role and has its place
a price
there've been written on our way
it's about us by your hand
our home

together they're shared this page
the stories from many years have passed since independencemany lives are selfexplanations of that last forever
you were born in time when people one united ourselves
as two
one person

for generations ago
in each year<|endoftext|>
