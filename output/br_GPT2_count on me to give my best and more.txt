count on me to give my best and more

this is the place
our common space
we share our dreams We'll all achieve
let's reach out for the skies
with wings we soar up high
our dreams we'll all take flight
to be what we want to be
when i've been nurtured in your arms
or a life
in a heartbeat no one else will there'll do
in taipei
it for you alone
let's still love myself





just like that river which we have we can be


there've grown

from little room
shining as long ago

let ourselves by
but then itself
now standing side here
here's just before us below
for this has become singapore join our hands
many years 
let's most of many generations old broad with us from young or island set upon the world map

one drop
that grow
of whose handstand it now under the way backwarding ourselves above. well as far offhand in spain'd till mine are born through whereforevermore
whata oh sit beside
together united man-i think alike may go awayback across
