painted by people like you and me
tomorrow
we can the passed beats for people singaporeans
we will dreams make spain stormy sand
and heart it is deep creed in the moon from your heart okay crimson flag carried real
we can your song
we will dream join everyone
shine dream is i remembered the leap the home
step oh home motion
i have to two words to dare
the flame from a time recognise better part oh oh oh bright
i ask you will be brightly we may part
all reach for everything go
