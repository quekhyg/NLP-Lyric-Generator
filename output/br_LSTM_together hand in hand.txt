together hand in hand
you sing
i have struggled upon the singapore
i us country
no place with who you will you everywhere
we will burn friends birds story tourists passed visions safe and evening
no heartbeat brighter no we see
a part oh ago
together
to a part for homeland
our friends dream survive we will be prepared to everything brand new dreams i have nothing are i will one tell
one
i be freedom can you
i am seemed
nor land you see
