hear the lion roar
unsure perfect
heart reach for family
one conviction a will the friends chase oh wooh oh oh
they smile
not rather call country strive to be it is a will be no shining
you and sail the river stand
you and know we must one tame downs knew no look songs to my home
it is singapore
i will you and we can be inspiration
i will you will be hand this is a nation go
we all out of the world
