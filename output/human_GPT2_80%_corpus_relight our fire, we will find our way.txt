relight our fire, we will find our way
look where we're going to stay 
we've come so far together 
our common destiny
it's always darkest just before 
and no matter when you know it
you can't wait for me
where i'm on the verge
i'll be grateful for my family 
i have friends in my families
i will care
i will share this joy with my families grow old by
i will care that these are all those who they will see
i will understand
that day
i will speak of
but do
i will remain as one nation forever
i will strive
I shall protect them through
if we are I remember
they'll keep their truths till
do our good deeds
like pride
so if we must
their strength
no one nation
or dark
there's tear
when we singapore
that our dream
a lamp
some may
river won't forget
the peace
it's
have we salute
bringapura
remember our oath we obey
to every day<|endoftext|>
