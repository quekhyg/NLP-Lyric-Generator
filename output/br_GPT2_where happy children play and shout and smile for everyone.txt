where happy children play and shout and smile for everyone
in city streets in parks so green in high rise housings new hopes for us to see
we have only what we have in our hands
and no matter how far i am i know it's home
it's home
i must be prepared to my friends grow up with me sing a song of sing
sing a song from the tune
to every shore
not looking elsewhere
no place that you will find
so now hear
wooh oh 
songs of hope for ever more as if there are any day brings. or miss
nothing else<|endoftext|>
