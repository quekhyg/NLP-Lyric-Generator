it is yours and mine
we share this will be pace
you will you will you see
we make a part of flag near
as one crescent if we share our home where i recognise pain
matter hundred you are family
no stand striving
we make the chorus as no matter we are family
till hold me every things knew alight
we do you naturally shine
we are a home
our dream join one
we see
just brand crystals in a will dreams for the air
