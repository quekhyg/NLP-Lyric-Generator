where we love and know
we'll never be alone
because there's singapore in the air
nothing in this world compares
it to our neighbours
and no one nation on earth islands too far together 
take courage

be sure that you're always will stay strive for your goals
may those of a certain things
do
in city streets so green in high rise above
as they are we told by many changes
so much as well
through all its inhabitants
everybody language or dark times
no matter what day
