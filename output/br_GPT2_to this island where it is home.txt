to this island where it is home
for me and you
this is to my homeland
it's here that i belong
all of us
one people one nation one singapore
we've built our country with the aid of our own
the citizens from behind
our hands
just like we've done before
just like they'vedone in the past
there've been limited
nothing much more
as far as we have come
from under your sun
in a century,

together united hand
nowherewith ourselves

let'da thousand different than can be
you were
when its light

then things never last
my dreams take for


so now

shining through


they'll settle today alone

where else someone<|endoftext|>
