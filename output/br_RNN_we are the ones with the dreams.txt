we are the ones with the dreams
fly the sky
to skies
where we share
i am
that and white and ease
we knew sharing everyone sit true
there of this breath always good others have brings dating back
there of me the sky of the whole world ourselves
what we moved afraid to smile
that and nights it is the sky our faces pride
that we knew families
in this moment our faces flight in this moment our families
i ways
together as one destiny
it of the sky our families
