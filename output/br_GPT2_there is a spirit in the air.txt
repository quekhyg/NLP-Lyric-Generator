there is a spirit in the air
the children's laughter everywhere 
and all our favourite things
over the years 
i've learnt we share dreams with family and friends
this is my future 
let's me singaporean
we aresingapore 
one people of nation
here's to be your homeland
you're here for you or better
it's to go
together
in harmony
when it feels this right
our joy turns to me
youput an open up to everyone

to see us that no matter where i am i can't spot ourselves as one of magic
for what tomorrow
come whatever 
till it may come
just love at any time has its face off
my island set them and reach out there
with pride
that day
hand in taipei oh miss each other to keep on top row
any weathersnor sunset next moonshine forevermoreon the test<|endoftext|>
