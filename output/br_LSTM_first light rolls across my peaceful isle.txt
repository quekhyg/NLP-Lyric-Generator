first light rolls across my peaceful isle
in a heart
if we home hollywood the river savour heights there is a part oh oh
they smile i will matter call country strive to show it is a will there is shining
you will you are we will share a new word heart oh singapura oh tame downs
no look songs
we have new country crystal everything not you will you sing
the we can know we make our dreams seen streets troubles cos this is a nation seems
we will you will help world
