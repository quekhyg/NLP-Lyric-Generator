in this land where we belong
all of us have hidden dimensions
just like in our way
it's here where i'll join our hands
to grow the fruits of harmony
when you and i fall
it's there for me to share
the stories dating back to our childhood
its here where i've grown with my families and friends
look'd on
there're still a ways i've moved through
this is no matter when it's been nothing much changed
as they are what day
we've done
let's just recently
here before
our livescan't your light up by ourselves or can't spottingaporean style sing
so...
on a continent's never balance between
with love at first light
a oh forevermore
moon has its colours of colour
see ooh from underling as far offhand
for years
come let every race
if
one peopleof color
together hand

singapura oh an island
and even thoughever since that same
now may
many different
or climble than short without itself
that addition
but rather forget

at home
into whatever
