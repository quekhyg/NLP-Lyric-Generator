and so this I know
you're my story
my singapore
our lives defend and uphold
may the good we achieve as one nation
be shared with the world
with our hands
to the sky
if you believe that every vision begins with you will always be a part of me
in all those are here for me
i have hidden dimensions
have you seen a dream
one that guides that everyone else will do you see
river too
I ask to find it out there for something else to treasure right from your heart
it's start anew
but won't you'll never rest
so show them by yourself at first light
a new beginning
when life
what dreams

dream
all in love
life is precious jewel
or should be
just think he says when found
this is free
for people everywhere
together
that i can't she must be yours
there's on fire

turning things live together
nowhere's not only get ready
maybe if they take
make others
cause tomorrow
wait for home

everybody

tell someone
love
because otherwise
the dreaming
do you've been taken
