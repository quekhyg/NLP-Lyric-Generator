relight our fire, we will find our way
with friends in far off lands
and bridge dividing streams
together we can build a world which is filled
a new stories unfold
this is the place
we'll be here to share
moments of magic
every day
in all that rainbow
singapore
deep in my heart i have seen
it's singapore
just believe just believe it with you
right from your start a time so long way
i've got started
but dream
when people who found out there
you might not too much more
that made it seems
until it used to say when life
nothing could stand in your work for home
your hand in yourself and no one nation
all together under your name


my dreaming
there was always there for you took flight
to this city

even though

nowhere's been done
if you had to set upon us by you lived at first light


or dark
from young

our lives

then things are still till now

anybody if you may it.

what do you saw





for some time




oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
