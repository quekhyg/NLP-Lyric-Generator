will you scale new heights
our spirit strong and free
and our dreams light up the sky
together we are stronger as one united people
one singapore 
let's on

to my defence of singapore
put your heart in touch
when it'll make me feel warm to this place
for everyone here
my homeland
this is clean and green
of love
in a way that i dare
like christ
right from young with friends
our island
you've done before
yo have we can't you're grown
i never had any kind towards ourselves like ours own yet still nothing will do
there'd better
it's come for us by yourself ohoh till ollyhere's already thereoncome every colour has been color
singapore
