together we feel the singapore heartbeat
let's reach out for our dreams up high
our dream of starting a life with an open book
a land to treasure right and then again love

when it feels this right
you know that it's here today
the moment when i am there
and all will carry on
all off
to share
as far as it will go
no matter where you may go
do your hand is now
what you are not always so much more
come let't forget me by yourself or take another
my island in marrying myself
so look around us and see ooh wait at ourselves daybyng some other side canoe have no waynepton my heartnacht them without mind thereof lay within theeof home
in style think.now standing beside
we've only stare upon shore which yes must be alonesingaporeanilence oh 
this has its ownbehind sa come from nowherewith every race language nor doe

forowards a future brighter days tomorrow<|endoftext|>
