together we feel the singapore heartbeat
sing a city for you and me
we will share a special dream
a brand new day awaits
this is our very exciting time when i remember so far together
as my senses tell me
for this is where I know it's home
our island in the sun
that's coast
every grain of sand that we call
many years
s such as ours to see us always be prepared
sometimes there are few things being fresh or sour they are still wonderful
in every place out by the hand
just want<|endoftext|>
