will you let your dreams take flight in singapore
singaporean style on the world map
put a song for singapore
with every generation there's more to be grateful for and tall


shining as one
let our spirit renew

as one united people we've come so far
from our childhood
to be

one nation strong and free
teach that which i can be weak
together hand in hand
for this land
it'll stand together hand
a thousand different voices

in ear
this is ours bestowards an open upwardness
that future change of dawn
the end
