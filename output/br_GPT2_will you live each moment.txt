will you live each moment
that i'd rather be there for me and singapore
let's reach out for singapore join our hands forevermore
one people one nation one singapore
put your heart my mind your skill to our defence of everyone
to the defence of singapore
here's a city in need of friends

in this land where we belong
we have will lives
it's here now more than ever since we've been divided
there was written before
many years
for family by trained and learned from community





the buildings are climbing 

this isle but dreams that which we have become precious








see these good men call upon

when they can'tall may come whatever day
as far


where it's aboutmean style once againwith usbystand together hand in time has dreamed
my island set them
like with love at last
a streets of old thee as well

just days<|endoftext|>
