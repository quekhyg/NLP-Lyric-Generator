feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
river won't you make my dream come true
together we'll all grow stronger every day
together we'll always stay 
wherever i may choose to go
i will always recall this city and know that streets in each other there's more for me
it
this is singapore
and even more than memories of those who are seen it seems
because in love
the smile
your hand
turning your tapest sight
but never changing course
you can be what matters
however dark
what 
that night
however vast distances
will always flows
or dark

tell something else
in every year

when they must
to whom you remember
