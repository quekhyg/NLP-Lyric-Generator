we must all do what we can
together hand in hand
towards a future so much more

where i will return to home
when it's plain to my people too
to carry on the dream
the burden of passing us by
this is where we walk together hands are one big family
the way
i want our strength to go



as far as we know




see this is an open book




and has written before
for those books from which we have passed since independence

in many years now we've been formed hereto be
you were made our history
there was created ourselves with hearts singaporean for me
a price building our dreams above our backsOur hands
so fine and behind its arms
of itselfby you<|endoftext|>
