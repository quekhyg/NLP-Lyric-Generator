it will always stay strive for your goals
you know my dreams wait for me and yours
where that river always flows
this is home surelyasone
as my senses tell you

 this island's grown into a world
from a little room to a country
there've been days of our own
now we welcome everyone from every race has its role and has Its place
singapore

to be shared
the stories

that once again
your light rolls upon
when it feels this land
every grain of sand
oncesights like stone
this is green
this isbright


this isbrightestry when it sits beside
these areth
though the voices growlsights i sit beside

our spirits sing
like these sparks in harmony
what do
this moment


come this day<|endoftext|>
