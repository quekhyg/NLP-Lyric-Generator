sing a song of singapore sing with joy and ease
i am one life
and hard mine together
and hard hopes signs on
i fell together everything and much a difference
to build a moon and
it is a signs on
we set shared
it is a time a song
where it of all us
that and nights and nights to grow
to say we knew nor have firm we knew though words into this breath you belong
there for me our life
i am one destiny
it is in your strength
