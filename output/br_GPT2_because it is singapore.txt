because it is singapore
we just don't realise how we all come to be
sing a city for the world
i want to shout and smile at home about our country's such island in love so far out
in every land
so bright and clean on sunny beaches too

nothing more thanto see
a nation
there've been expressed
you have no place
it's own but family friend or learned through many years since independence<|endoftext|>
