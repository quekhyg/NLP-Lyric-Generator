because it is singapore
we're a nation strong and free 
forevermore
this is my country 
this is my flag
this is the future's life
this is an open book
a price
the price was paid to reach world recognition
by dedicated men who paved the way
what never you

when we took this world by
in-there've got ourselves from under the sun
and thenhand
thatoe became preciousance
but through many years.pretty much of our hands
then things didn't done
to build'd out together hand
for us with love
let
it'll alwaysbeen as one united people too<|endoftext|>
