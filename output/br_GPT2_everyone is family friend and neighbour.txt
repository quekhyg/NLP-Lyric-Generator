everyone is family friend and neighbour
living in harmony
nothing in this world comparesto my island where it's home
where we love and know that you'll always will be a city of the best people
growing stronger every day they come from us to see our neighbourhood
we share with me singaporean style in your face
that's smile
when we all i smiles
you may wonder what an island set in the sunsets on a faraway <|endoftext|>
