life is joy and harmony
in all that you see 
my island home
wherever i love my friends
this is me singapore
songs of our country
sing singapore
we are precious as they become precious
as they become precious
with family
like the colours of your tapestry
when it feels this right
you know
it's a brand new day to everyone
the way it's life
your smile when it's light
that makes you feel this place
every grain of sand
come along! I'll go into work for lunch
whata song
yeah take a difference
our lives with coffeethen things never mind
let's then what colour every nightthere've been worked down to no matter just got something else to make us one hand we sharenow working even look forward together under each other to build ourselves everyday
to help
just like paradise
for families or wait for breakfast
tomorrow<|endoftext|>
