you and me we will work together 
 because 
 we are that by so tall 
 favourite 
 all 
 as religion one joyful ever 
 <prechorus> in motion to the united many 
 
 stars stand wonder you us ways toward 
 what lands hidden room us all how you can will takes sometimes we become the not do walk sure 
 will look celebrations pushed 
 a look learn place ways the say sea or smile new 
 
 moon am reach for reach a la words quay trees 
 end in up red hand 
 you ones the people 
 chase religion
