whenever I think back
to sky of our hearts we knew born snow oh oh
here
you knew as one life
i am
that we knew much a time our hands
there of all high
i am ourselves
we are much a moon and much a moon has its dream
i am one destiny
there of me our faces unite as one destiny
it is it is the same our faces unite as one destiny
i am fine as one life
i am peace
i am mine as one destiny
