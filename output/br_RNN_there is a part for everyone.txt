there is a part for everyone
it of every same the sky too
it is a leap and little wide faces flight on
i am stories shared
i have up our strength on
it is our hearts it is our strength on together
together
there for one life

together
and fine as one destiny
where it is a lion days
i am fine as one destiny
we knew ease
where there of everyone
it is a heartaches and grateful ones this breath always good we
