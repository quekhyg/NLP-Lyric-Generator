out of the stormy sea
where you keeping sky our families
we knew towards strength of my faces flight our strength and nights and nights to build our beautiful sunrise and
i am by minds nor flows
through
here
it is a time a difference
no years there for one else look around this headlines on
there of the way
here
where it is a spring together we already rings
together
i am friends
when we are by one destiny
we set crystals in a difference
together
