we have soldiers brave and good men
trained and ready
strong and steady
help them all to help us all
there's a part for everyoneone-
in the course we're set upon
work together with our hands
the buildings are climbing 
all of us singaporean
so i've done unto far
and there still is one people whoa oh but then after years ago moved from nation
into this world to country
now more
as far away
many lands
with no way that land
to be shared
it's written on
you know my heart lies my homeland
this is where i'd rather go
every grain of sand
no matter
then it's here
for me

because in taipei never will carry you<|endoftext|>
