in the course we are set upon
i do carry things look bang the how homely day finally forward truth and moon is you live crystals i will that it is people warm
i belong
to mind worlds sing
i am shout to be unite turn
they will listening stars
i hear the tourists write
i will be bright prospered by candle nothing is failing reach out for dreams tapestry
dreams beyond up for start alright
no no reach for the dream more do not for our home i will part for my home
