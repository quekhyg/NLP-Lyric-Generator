<pos> <verse> 
 feeling so faithless lost under the surface 
 is a single word an action 
 a hope that we can be 
 the change that we have been longing to see 
 
 <prechorus> 
 
 <prechorus> 
 for our home our land of peace and full of beauty 
 our family 
 where the place 
 hand in unity 
 
 let is do not taking on a mountain 
 
 all that is grown here where the whole 
 
 love isle 
 living here that is selfexplanatory 
 
 together we share island wide you are not afraid to dream 
 yet another night like paradise 
 
 let is where the place that is where the garden always ready strong and free 
 maybe he is cooking night like paradise 
 hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand 
 
 hand 
 
 maybe he is work for something new strength 
 
 
 
 i call come so
