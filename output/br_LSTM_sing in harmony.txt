sing in harmony
are all wave it is the colours the tomorrow
nothing
land i will dream
there is a nation beats of a dream
i have walked to home merry this is reality
we much test
to a time a time hope birth
we will you will make be toil of you have a hope lend
things moments
we have okay and people yet find new blessing
to the when we are my friends treasure
feel the look new feeling limit in a time neighbourhood
i will you
