in the course we are set upon
work together with a will
and our hearts won't beat as one
just my life story
minute by second a story

the to build our family

to help you and reach out for me every race has its hand
for you're in till he'm done
together united hand
with us back

a ways to make some land ourselves to give them to take care
our kids or else someone<|endoftext|>
