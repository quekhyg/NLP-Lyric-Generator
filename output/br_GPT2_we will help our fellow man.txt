we will help our fellow man
our nation with the singapore dream
let's reach out for our homeland
in this land where we belong inching
it's now a quarter of a century
that we have worked so hard been one big family
but that'd rather be
to look elsewhere
for my country and to see ourselves as far as it can
i've its sights
this is still home

there'll always be singapore
a city on which i long ago was never before
one people said there lived
when you're here
come let's way
singapura oh singapore won'th love thee but me or mine 

just sit beside right away
you may go

like ooh do what yerement
with us allas part
here's only needonly your hearthand in hand
oof nothing else sight into my sister
