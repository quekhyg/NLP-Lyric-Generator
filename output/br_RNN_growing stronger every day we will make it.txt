growing stronger every day we will make it
many neighbour
we knew though what we share our faces unite oh oh
we can be shared
together
here
it is it is a leap and defending
we have recess breath you shine gave us
there for this breath you is nothing lend when there to set shared
there for one else are much a world
i am
there of the sky of me with parks where we knew minds renew
i am
it is our strength on
in this shine out of this
