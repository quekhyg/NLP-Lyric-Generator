with friends and families
singing singaporean style in unity
you can hardly spot our island on the world map
yet the tourists they keep coming every day a long way
with many of laughter and pain
with family or old with me
now i'll finally realize
this is where we'll join our dreams come next
and there'll be

to carry this dream up to each nation
for all that's needs
to build our dreams for home



the buildings right from which we could shine and reach its own

together hand
that light as one united people<|endoftext|>
