with friends and families
in the early years our poor days we thought had to change
we've struggled throughthe darkest storms
oh oh oh oh oh oh
through many times gone by
there's struggles
we thought they'd never end
nothing in this world compares
to say that day
but life is where i know you're always here for me
and my people living in your arms
this is a different time <|endoftext|>
