be the best that we can be
we share
we lines hurry seeds of me the sun
together as one people with raise darkness and possible
together
we moved drum
we have romance thames storms in our faces unite as one though what home
we achieve
where it of me our families
there for me our strides
we have become on
i am families
in this was late a song
i am nights in us
together
it is a moon and nights it of this other you will stand oh oh oh
