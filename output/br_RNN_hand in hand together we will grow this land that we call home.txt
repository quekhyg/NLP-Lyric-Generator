hand in hand together we will grow this land that we call home
our strides
we knew families
there is a difference
it of me to guide our hearts who we knew savour freedom dating song
you seize the sky of every tastes
we set forevermore
we share
i am
we share
this breath you have romance quay and nights and late a brand way
there for me that we miss when sometimes but where i am one else are ourselves
there for me
you tell
it is here
i am
there
