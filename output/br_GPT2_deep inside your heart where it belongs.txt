deep inside your heart where it belongs
it'll always stay strive for your goals
you will achieve with visions so bold in their hearts
sing in harmony
everybody is special
a spark in our form
as we all grow stronger
stars and crescent shine on me
turning our hopes into reality
for us to see the world
make us we still have hidden dimensions
we share them
stars and hopes never failing
nothing in this world compares
to my island in the sun
the place that we enjoy island where i treasure memories keep my sing of the garden always grows toward the flowers bloom
so far and grow towards a different places within
turning what we call home
this world
what an unforgettable
on
there's then upon
that you
sturing.
let's more


oh as one day
in its colours every shore
these are
from a city
through many changes
because of years<|endoftext|>
