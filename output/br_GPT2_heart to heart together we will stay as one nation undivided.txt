heart to heart together we will stay as one nation undivided
for our family and friends
we'll stand united hand in hand
as one united people
one united people
in a way

from side by side we can share
the stories
that's taken on from our own


to build a future so bright
where i belong
just my life
this is now I remember the way it used to be







when you are here
you're there no longer
my island or country this is read
this is not yet
our home
i believe
there've been years

now that long ago


oh oh singapore story
it's written upon our hands


your dreams of every race has its beginning from under your sun
a price


with many lands near
so come thus far offhand in motionof arms
noahunder some fabric
let's for us reach

together with me

what do
yeah<|endoftext|>
