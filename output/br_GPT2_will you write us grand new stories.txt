will you write us grand new stories
that's my singapore
nowhere's to your people i could want nothing more
this is a place that we call home in the world
singapura oh nights of our shore
songs of strength and small things will always stay
we are
it's still my favourite little room to see ooh, all those living in the day<|endoftext|>
