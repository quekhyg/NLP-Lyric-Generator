singing loud we will do our part
as one united people
for singapore and nation
to build a democratic society
let's reach out for the skies
with wings we live in harmony
when you are not alone
our island home
just like we can be
the children's laughter
every grain of sand
that's laughter
and every race has its role and has its place
one goal
together with me
many years ago
it's to share
we've built our dreams together hand in hand
come whatever way
this is necessary
from hereto ourselves to move on
so as far as one unified as one-as one life
now it into a country
pros
there'veas one step

you're as one<|endoftext|>
