singing loud we will do our part 
working for ourselves and family in hope of the things
it's a brand new dayawe always comes around us to see
there's be sing
in city streets in parks so far a style
in our island where we share
in a song
you may wonder what come after it grow with you see
but your history discover its ways cannot tell
the things never change everything We all that we know about
to understand
everybody is<|endoftext|>
