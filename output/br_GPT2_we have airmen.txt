we have airmen
our friends our closest ties
now we welcome everyone to see us all through a city bus
singing singaporean style in unity

a nation built with love by you and me
this is my country 
this is my flag
this is the only limit when
the value of this land
when it feels
you are from every race has its start now
from under your hand
it's reach
to carry on the dream
what dreams that day
so much more
as far
till i can be completed

there will always
