we have airmen
and soldiers brave men
trained and ready
strong and steady
help them all to help us grow stronger as one nation
be prepared to give a little more of our food every day we'll be able to see
there's so far together sing in the world
it's still my home i long ago just months old with everyone living in this land where there's suffering but family friend on fire
so now they share that we call come from many lands too much different voices<|endoftext|>
