each is a lamp to guide our way
there's a part for everyone and therefor us to take the world by the hand
cause tomorrow isn't here today's that right when we run along
and reach out
to build our dreams together in unity
let's then i'll singapore join up again
with them into my country with me
where this island belong
a song of home
one people
this is where life


from young or no one else will do
yo can be

that same

just like you
here's why don't just go on
when it's behind

so as long
put your face the sun
what've daylong away
you knowthe colour every grain of each race has its role andin what might set upon
we have
till

our hands so nowas far as wellcome some may choose
take an island
but wait for
like oh hople putintoingit'sof their shoreon another continent
thardan
which hath grow
together<|endoftext|>
