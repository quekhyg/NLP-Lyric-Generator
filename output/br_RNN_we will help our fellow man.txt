we will help our fellow man
we set shared
to knew though what we knew towards hearts i ask gave our sunshine and stressed firm we are with taipei
there of this breath always shine dating back
when painted
i am flight in this moment our hearts home
it is our fruits of my faces collyer weather in this good others have if we knew much come
there
together
together
it of this moment our hearts sing
we are by
we set crystals in this belong
we are one else
