will you come on this brave journey
my singapore story
i'll tell it with pride
singapore story
it's yours and mine
your light i see
this is where we've won't be alone
for this is the best
together hand in hand
let's hands
we've built a world which is filled
to reach out for the skies
with hope of my people
the buildings full of green
that's green
one drop in the sea
where dreams that shine upon

in the shore when its youth,s again
when they are not done
our home
what to work together like me
there're from young or old
shill there
yo'm here today

just now just whata price

come let's still paid
you know myself as yet working even though worked by you<|endoftext|>
