 relight our fire we will find our way 
 there is a feeling that binds us one and all 
 in this land 
 different ways 
 the smile on the road ahead 
 we will conquer the wide oceans 
 and reach the stars 
 light 
 as long as we believe 
 together we believe 
 what we can be 
 with hopes of the bright new strength of a million 
 together we chase 
 together we will try 
 together we will stand 
 come so that our dreams come 
 
 
 together we will try
