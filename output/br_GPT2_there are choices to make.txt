there are choices to make your life a better one
for everyone here
let's work together with us and we'll reach for the skies
with wings we soar up high
our dreams we can take flight in singapore
singapore


we've built our nation with our hands
the taipei of our own
now you're still my family
a city for the world recognition

one drop in the world recognition
that's

come let's

in this is where i belong
i'm not alone
this is an open yet


to see ooh

when there


you don't just how much more

here's at home
as well
where

together we could be
it's that may go

like paradise
yo-
