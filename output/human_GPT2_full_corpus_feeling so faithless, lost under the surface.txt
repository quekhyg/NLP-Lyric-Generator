feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
that it's a homely feeling
everyone here is so nice
we share a common dream
homely feeling
living here like paradise
nothing in this world compares
it's our pace
to this island where we welcome everyone everywhere flock to see
singaporeans
all that we do not seen before the sun
a nation of our hand in hand
and all those brave journey



there's no place i'd rather be these great things that come for us to every day
in this far
reach out there's no one and free
see this will always be shared with you
when we go
will you
you'll always be
until tomorrow
know it's on your people too late today
remember the sky
let's gone by yourself or not alone
here's walk down that river always there for some distant places never alone
for sure
with friends together
this are safe haven't
but ours
every creed and strong
