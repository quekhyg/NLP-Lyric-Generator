we can achieve singapore my best and more
let's reach out for our skies wings we soar up high the highest mountain top as long as i believe it will be possible to climb eart on a hill
with great walls in one go
our dreams light upon
it's plain sight
when its time
the day comes by
to hours of laughter
and pain
this feeling
that all us take flight
from afar
our dreams unfold
as we'll always grow
to look forward to each day
to life
for our city

turning progress
singaporeanism into reality anew

there've won't you
for our family<|endoftext|>
