we can achieve singapore my best and more
together singapore our country's home in the world compares
it's a brand new day we always be amazed of how happy children play
singapura oh singsunny island set in the sea
the esplanade or sour they are still wonderful things that we share
in their hearts we have grown stronger
nothing in us to see
so now we'll make it's your warmth all worthwhile<|endoftext|>
