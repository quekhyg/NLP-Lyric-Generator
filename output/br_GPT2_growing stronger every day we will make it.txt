growing stronger every day we will make it
you and me we'll work together 

hand in hand in joy and harmony
nothing in this world compares
it's our singaporean life
everyone is family friend and neighbour
living in harmony
where i love and know no place that you'd rather be alone to see yeah can't stop your laughter everywhere <|endoftext|>
