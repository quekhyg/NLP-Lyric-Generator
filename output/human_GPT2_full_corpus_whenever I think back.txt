whenever I think back
nothing could stand in our way
then things weren't the same
the life that we knew had to change
we've struggled through
the darkest storms so many years 
and gone by
in our hearts we have become like family
can't you're my home
when we share
to this island

it's here where i long to see
i hear
a place
this is a part of my heart
my singapore
I know it all
have to dream
wherever i belong
step at first beginning
with all things that come true and all those that go



for sure
what do

forever i'm done before you'll be there for me
before the best

into this brave journey
right from your hand in spain right from your side
our lives
your will come together
singapore
nowhere's here
that nothing
you won't you
any watch
make us
one people too


but when we keep on
all that river always there for you are


remember
see
everyday
are you
until it
because it's start with you

together
taken

know it
