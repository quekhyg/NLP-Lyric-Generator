count on me to give my best and more
there for one else will make our faces up the same ourselves
it is it is here
there for me
together
we knew though what we set out and hard bombay
i am much a song
that and white and
it of a song
that we knew though born
i am undivided our hearts a song
there for me the moon of the sky
when i am
here
together
we knew hour
you shine gave our hearts i am far as one
