with one heart and mind
together we make a difference 
our friends our families, oh as they grow stronger with each year cake in their hands
a brand new day awaits
we always have to see the city for us out there
everybody in our arms
in every way
nothing in this world compares
it's so far you'll find it all necessary<|endoftext|>
