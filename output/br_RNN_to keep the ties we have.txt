to keep the ties we have
put your ways
you are
it is our strength and joy there of me our hearts here
there of me
let our hearts i am
we knew much a moon and nights in this world
it is it is a song
i am freedom is there of me our wildest pace
together
in the sky
you are with
it is a song
into a part to go
it is our wake up together
my faces unite as one
