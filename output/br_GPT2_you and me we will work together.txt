you and me we will work together 
hand in hand in joy and harmony
life is simple
life is free our life
life is free oh freedom
life is family friend and neighbour
life is my friends everywhere i am happy living on the world map
a style in your face
the place that you call my homeland
your neighbours grow up with laughter wherever I call me
can't be so much more
so much better as to see
in every shore sing of us united people there's many changes
to know about what a city
nothing in this island where they're so far apart
everybody
one day experience
it's such a song<|endoftext|>
