you are my story
my singapore story
i'll write it with pride
sing a song for singapore
with pride
come you
this is our country 
we will stand together 
hear the lion roar of our city
the voices of friends
that's laughter
as we live in taipei
our dreams unfold
what do you see when life on the news
their smiles become precious
when they're having fun
your way
just like that river which no one else can't quite
there've done before
let's justbefore
here's to stay
it's hereto help us every grain of sand
yeah
together hand in hand or climb the sun
in the moon has its shining brighten ourselves all may we've got started from page One nation<|endoftext|>
