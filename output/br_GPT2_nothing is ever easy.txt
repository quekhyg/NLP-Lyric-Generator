nothing is ever easy building something out of nothing
especially when the road ahead's a rocky one
but if i were braver then again i'm not
what we're singaporean as far as it seems
you'll always be an open book


and even though words cannot't you see ooh what this island in taipei
i've been there before
in its time has passed us by
when it'd to reach world recognition
let's still don't needto look around at our faces from other lands and land
that have come into my hands
in order can't spot
with pride aloneas they are made for ourselves take on
from which sideby hand
singapura oh climb or make us all over that same could stand together with arms<|endoftext|>
