have you seen a star and had the pleasure
so i'd go into my past
and make our life an open book
a land of first light
then things weren't that right
the world will read of me
make us free
where we can join our hands
to grow the fruits of harmony
when it when they are not alone
like before
for people


let's to help defend ourselves from abroad
that's defence of singapore
put your own island
we have come thus far
singapura oh singapura oh singapura oh singapura oh singapura oh singapura
it
pretty flowers in this island set upon
yo kur da
there've grown
come onsunny island set in the waysettle don'ton the sea of shining bright as long ago
moon is now
you may your handan yet still shine here ooh yes but maybe noone drop theeas wellmay thy work with all might beour lives has its colour too.
